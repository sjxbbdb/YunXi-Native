# Extraction Status

## Current Workspace Version: v2.1.0

The current workspace integrates the pure Rust persona, memory, relationship,
companion, control, and evaluation boundaries into one auditable general
companion runtime. Earlier sections are retained as historical release records.

## v2.1.0 Integrated TUI And Streaming Release Regression

- A fixture-driven Ratatui TestBackend suite stores paired main-view and
  Details goldens for normal companion output, long streaming Markdown,
  approval/tool failure, CJK/Emoji narrow layout, history scroll/resize,
  stream fault recovery, and monochrome semantics.
- Normal-view goldens enforce the quiet transcript boundary; raw reasoning,
  Provider wire bodies, tool arguments, and complete tool output remain
  available only in the paired Details frame.
- A VT100 transcript golden covers ANSI reset, resize, alternate screen,
  bracketed paste, focus tracking, mouse capture, cursor hide/show, and reverse
  restoration for normal, Ctrl+C, tool-failure, and Provider-error exits.
- Existing CLI mode-matrix tests continue to prove that plain, pipe, CI,
  one-shot, command, JSON, JSONL, `--no-tui`, and forced-TUI fallback paths do
  not emit TUI bytes.
- `scripts/conpty/v209` now separates explicit `.tmp` capture from pure
  read-only formal verification. `scripts/conpty/v210` adds the consolidated
  Windows ConPTY release gate and binds its evidence to the Rust golden hashes.
- The runtime remains YunXi-owned Rust; evidence-only Node dependencies do not
  enter the product dependency graph.

## v2.0.9 Cross-Path Terminal Recovery And Streaming Resilience

- `yunxi-agent-cli/src/terminal_mode.rs` owns one resolver matrix for TUI,
  plain, pipe, CI, one-shot, command, JSON, JSONL, `--no-tui`, and forced-TUI
  fallback. Non-TUI integration tests reject ANSI, alternate-screen, and TUI
  footer bytes.
- `yunxi-agent-tui/src/host.rs` records terminal entry actions and restores
  cursor, mouse capture, focus tracking, bracketed paste, alternate screen, and
  raw mode in reverse order. Tests cover complete enter/drop and partial-entry
  rollback.
- Provider network parsing now carries incomplete UTF-8 bytes between chunks,
  preserves split CJK/emoji input, and rejects confirmed invalid sequences
  without exposing raw bytes.
- Markdown live tails are capped at 64 KiB and combined content at 256 KiB.
  History cells, debug/details, tool fields, seen event IDs, archived streams,
  and total history cells have explicit deterministic limits with
  redaction-before-grapheme-truncation.
- Timeline tests cover disconnect/timeout-style finalization, duplicate final,
  reliable out-of-order delta, cancel followed by late delta, and predictable
  archive/seen-event eviction. Partial content is frozen and the next turn can
  proceed.
- The existing v2.0.8 semantic palettes and 58/80/100/120/200-column snapshots
  remain green, as do v2.0.7-hotfix Approval/Details focus guards.
- `scripts/conpty/v209` is an evidence-only Windows ConPTY verifier for terminal
  restoration, non-TUI byte isolation, Provider recovery, and oversized stream
  cancellation/recovery. Node is not part of the product runtime.

## v2.0.8 Visual Semantics And Information Density

- `yunxi-agent-tui/src/styles.rs` now owns full-color, ANSI-16, and monochrome
  semantic styles for transcript roles, activity states, headers, footers,
  borders, focus, success, and selection.
- `render.rs` and `transcript_layout.rs` consume semantic roles rather than
  scattered color policy. Approval, warning, error, cancellation, and
  action-required states retain explicit text/modifier redundancy with
  `NO_COLOR`.
- Header/subheader priority drops backend/source/debug diagnostics below 90
  columns. Shared layout and Approval sizing cover 58, 80, 100, 120, and 200
  columns without overlapping transcript and bottom-pane ownership.
- A new 58x18 full-frame snapshot joins the existing 80x24, 100x30, 120x40,
  and 200x50 baselines. TUI tests total 144 and preserve the v2.0.7-hotfix
  Approval/Details focus guards, grapheme editing, drafts, and one-cell stream
  lifecycle.
- `scripts/conpty/v208` records two real DeepSeek/Windows ConPTY scenarios:
  completed responsive conversation frames and a monochrome Approval/default
  Decline/provider-error/active-stream-cancel sequence. The sanitized manifest
  and frame hashes are independently verified; v207-hotfix and v207 historical
  verifiers also remain green.
- The default runtime remains YunXi-owned Rust. Node dependencies are confined
  to evidence collection and do not enter the CLI or core dependency graph.

## v2.0.6 Composer, Input Recovery, And Dialog Consistency

The TUI now owns one grapheme-indexed `EditBuffer` instead of exposing byte
cursor semantics through Composer state. Composer and `request_user_input`
share insertion, CRLF normalization, newline, movement, Home/End, deletion,
submit, snapshot, and restore behavior. Rendering consumes the buffer's safe
cursor mapping and caps the Composer body at six rows around the cursor.

Approval and user-input views suspend rather than replace the Composer.
Streaming accepts a next-turn draft but disables Enter submission and Esc
clearing until the active turn ends. The CLI drains already queued terminal
input before entering a blocking overlay, and Windows input draining continues
to a 5ms quiet period once a burst begins. A Windows-only burst classifier
handles ConPTY/crossterm LF as an embedded Ctrl+Enter without changing isolated
Enter behavior.

Provider delta, final, and completed events continue to update one canonical
assistant cell. Added regression tests prove that final/completed events do not
duplicate the answer or modify the pretyped draft. The TUI suite contains 126
tests, including 80/100/120/200-column long-input and Unicode frames.

The reproducible real-provider gate is stored in `scripts/conpty/v206` with
locked `node-pty@1.1.0` and `@xterm/headless@5.5.0` dependencies. Eight
sanitized DeepSeek/Windows ConPTY scenarios and a SHA-256 manifest live in
`docs/reports/evidence/frames/v206-conpty`; the offline verifier passes while
the existing `v205` verifier remains unchanged and passing.

## v2.0.5 Tool Activity, Approval, And Decoder

The current release consolidates tool lifecycle events into one stable TUI
activity cell, uses a decline-by-default approval bottom pane, and separates
safe summaries from details/debug diagnostics. `ExecOutputDecoder` reads raw
stdout/stderr bytes, handles invalid UTF-8 and binary output without surfacing
decoder exceptions, and records truncation/integrity metadata. Error summaries
use stable category codes and actionable next steps. JSON and JSONL event
shapes remain compatible because execution details are internal presentation
metadata.

The current audit remediation routes every user-visible provider/tool/approval/
cancel/terminal/unknown failure through `ErrorPresentation`. Stable summaries
carry code, retryability, next action, and a details reference without exposing
raw diagnostics. Approval decline and Ctrl+C remain one activity cell; the only
permitted terminal refinement is a later structured `Declined -> Cancelled`
decision for the same tool id.

The real Windows ConPTY gate is now recorded in
`docs/reports/evidence/2026-07-20-v2-0-5-error-presentation-conpty-evidence.md`.
DeepSeek live sessions cover the 80/100/120/200 width matrix, approval,
rejection, cancellation, non-zero exit, invalid UTF-8, binary fallback, long
output truncation/details, and subsequent input. The original `v2.0.5` tag is
unchanged. Error presentation shipped as `v2.0.5-hotfix.1`; the native ConPTY
dependency reproducibility remediation shipped and passed re-audit as
`v2.0.5-hotfix.2`. Neither hotfix moved an earlier tag.

The 11:34 re-audit required independent ConPTY replay rather than Markdown-only
evidence. `scripts/conpty/v205` now contains the collector, exact npm dependency
lock, scenario runner, offline verifier, and reproduction instructions. Eight
sanitized raw-frame JSON files and a SHA-256 manifest are retained in
`docs/reports/evidence/frames/v205-conpty`. A full collector run and offline
manifest verification both pass.

## v2.0.4-hotfix.1 Responsive Header Audit Remediation Candidate

The project owner explicitly selected `2.0.4-hotfix.1` and the new annotated
`v2.0.4-hotfix.1` tag for the failed v2.0.4 visual audit. The published
`v2.0.4`, `v2.0.3-hotfix.1`, `v2.0.3`, `v2.0.2-hotfix.1`, and `v2.0.2` tags
remain immutable.

`YunxiTuiApp::header_for_width` now chooses its information set before invoking
shared priority clipping. Widths below 90 contain only product/version and
provider connection state; widths from 90 through 119 add model data without
constructing cwd; widths of 120 or more add a path-boundary-compacted cwd.
The 80/100/120/200 matrix has explicit positive and negative assertions, and
repository-owned full-frame snapshots confirm the same behavior through the
real render path.

## v2.0.4 International Text And Responsive Layout (Superseded Audit Candidate)

The TUI now uses one internal `TextLayout` module for Unicode display-width
measurement, grapheme-safe wrapping and truncation, visual-line source ranges,
and byte-index-to-visual-cursor mapping. Transcript, composer, approval, and
responsive status rendering share this path instead of maintaining independent
character and token splitting implementations.

Wrapping has explicit natural-text, long-token, URL, Windows-path, and code
policies. CJK, Japanese kana, emoji ZWJ sequences, and combining characters are
kept atomic. Composer movement, deletion, backspace, height calculation, and
cursor rendering use the same grapheme and visual-row model.

Header, subheader, footer, and approval rendering introduced explicit
must-keep, important, optional, and debug-only priorities. This candidate was
superseded because its narrow header still admitted model and cwd segments when
they happened to fit, despite remaining within the terminal width.

Full normalized `ratatui::TestBackend` frames at 80x24, 100x30, 120x40, and
200x50 are checked into `crates/yunxi-agent-tui/src/snapshots`. The matrix covers
international text, URL/path/code wrapping, active assistant output, pinned
history, `new output below`, scrollbar, footer, and composer. Approval rendering
has a separate four-width matrix. The v2.0.3-hotfix.1 redraw, viewport, resize,
and cancellation model remains unchanged.

## v2.0.3-hotfix.1 Redraw Audit Remediation Candidate

The project owner explicitly selected `2.0.3-hotfix.1` and the new annotated
`v2.0.3-hotfix.1` tag for the failed v2.0.3 audit remediation. The published
`v2.0.3`, `v2.0.2-hotfix.1`, and `v2.0.2` tags remain immutable.

The default coalesced redraw interval is now 33,334 microseconds, strictly below
the 30 FPS hard ceiling. `RedrawScheduler::record_draw` counts only successful
production-path draw records. A deterministic test manually advances `Instant`
while injecting 1,000 deltas over one second and asserts no more than 30 draws
and far fewer draws than deltas. Immediate and next-frame invalidations retain
their existing semantics.

Full normalized frame snapshots at 80x24 and 120x40 are checked into
`crates/yunxi-agent-tui/src/snapshots`. Both traverse the real layout and wrap
path with active streaming, pinned history, new output below, scrollbar,
footer, and composer. Tests also assert stable region coordinates, no overlap,
scrollbar containment, row width bounds, and required frame content.

## v2.0.3 Redraw, Scroll, And Resize Stability (Superseded Audit Candidate)

The TUI host now owns a reason-aware `RedrawScheduler`. High-rate provider
deltas and ordinary status changes were coalesced on the original 33 ms host
tick; final/control state is rendered on the next frame; input, scroll, resize,
cancellation, and errors remain immediate. The scheduler records the set of
pending causes and clears it after a successful draw.

`WrappedTranscript` maps each screen row to a stable `TuiCellId` and logical
line offset. `TranscriptViewport` stores `FollowTail`, `Pinned`, or
`NewOutputBelow` anchors and resolves them again after stream finalization,
content append, and terminal width/height changes. Resize wrapping is
grapheme-safe for CJK, emoji ZWJ, combining marks, and long tokens. Explicit
saturating layout rules cover tiny terminal heights without overlapping panes
or invalid cursor placement. Plain CLI, `--no-tui`, JSON, JSONL, runtime, and
provider contracts remain unchanged.

This published candidate failed independent audit because 33 ms is not a strict
30 FPS ceiling and it lacked the required 1,000-delta draw count plus 80x24 and
120x40 full-frame snapshots. The immutable release is superseded only by the
explicitly approved hotfix remediation above.

## v2.0.2-hotfix.1 Streaming Audit Remediation Candidate

This is the explicitly selected hotfix re-audit candidate for the new annotated
`v2.0.2-hotfix.1` tag. The published annotated `v2.0.2` tag remains unchanged.
Provider stream messages now carry TUI-only structured
identity from `yunxi-agent-runtime`: thread ID, turn ID, stream/message ID,
stable event ID, explicit provider-reliable/local-fallback sequence, and phase.
The core message identity remains skipped by serde, so existing AgentEvent JSON
and JSONL contracts remain unchanged.

`crates/yunxi-agent-tui/src/timeline_store.rs` owns the stream lifecycle and the
mapping from a stream session to its canonical `TuiCellId`. Its state machine
handles delta, retry, final, finish, and cancel. Event IDs are the idempotency
key; only provider-reliable sequences participate in late-event rejection, and
distinct local-fallback events are accepted regardless of local numeric arrival
order. Duplicate event IDs increment a bounded diagnostic counter. Final and
cancel remove full content/controllers from the active map and retain at most
256 minimal archive records; seen event IDs are also bounded.

`MarkdownStreamController` is scoped to each active session and commits complete
lines, paragraph boundaries, closed Markdown fences, or safe Unicode grapheme
boundaries. Emoji ZWJ, combining marks, CJK, kana, fences, repeated payloads,
and long tokens have state-level exactness coverage.

`presentation.rs` supplies identity and visibility, `chat.rs` applies explicit
assistant timeline updates, and the raw TUI host now classifies Ctrl+C during an
active turn. The CLI cancels the shared run token, while the runtime selects
between provider completion and cancellation so the in-flight provider future
is dropped immediately. Automated coverage proves partial text is preserved,
late deltas cannot rebind a cancelled session, and the next user input is
accepted. Offline TUI, workspace tests, release build, and Evaluation Harness
pass. An authorized isolated DeepSeek live TUI run returned one canonical
`LIVE_OK` cell, cancelled an active long stream while retaining partial text,
accepted a following prompt, and returned `NEXT_OK`. Formal independent re-audit
remains pending after the candidate is published.

## YunXi Agent v2.0.1 Quiet TUI Presentation

The TUI now owns a single `AgentEvent -> TuiEvent` presentation boundary in
`crates/yunxi-agent-tui/src/presentation.rs`. `event_filter.rs` applies only
pure transcript/debug/hidden visibility rules; `chat.rs` stores classified
cells and stable details references; `render.rs` renders those cells without
interpreting runtime events. The CLI TUI bridge no longer special-cases
assistant visibility.

The default transcript permits user and assistant messages, safe progress and
tool-state summaries, approvals, notices, and sanitized error summaries. Raw
reasoning, memory/context decisions, hidden prompts, provider wire content,
`arguments_json`, complete stdout/stderr, stack traces, and unredacted tool
parameters are excluded from the default view and retained only as redacted,
stable-ID debug/details entries. Assistant deltas pass through the Markdown
stream controller with separate stable source and live tail state.

This is a TUI-only presentation change. Core event order and structure, plain
CLI, JSON/JSONL, approval, user-input, and cancellation contracts are unchanged.
No upstream TUI crate or non-Rust runtime was added.

## YunXi Agent v2.0.0 General Companion Agent

`yunxi-agent-runtime` now exposes `GeneralCompanionSnapshot` and
`general_companion_snapshot`. This public facade reports the effective persona,
memory schema, read-only relationship state, proactive defaults, cloud-control
state, and shared control snapshot without leaking upstream Codex internals.
The default runtime remains YunXi-owned and requires no upstream Codex runtime,
cloud service, Python process, or external scheduler.

The v2 integration regression runs two independent sessions against isolated
local state. It verifies that an extracted language preference survives the
session boundary, the latest relationship fact enters persona context, the
superseded fact remains auditable but is not recalled, and control summaries do
not count invalidated/superseded records as active. Proactive behavior and cloud
control remain default-off, relationship controls remain read-only, and tool
approval is not bypassed.

The 31 deterministic v1.9.4 evaluation scenarios and their golden thresholds
are retained unchanged as the v2.0.0 release gate. CLI black-box coverage also
checks the v2 version, offline one-shot execution, shared controls, full JSON
evaluation output, and zero tool-approval bypasses.

## YunXi Agent v1.9.4 Evaluation Harness

The `yunxi-agent-eval` crate loads 31 small JSONL scenarios from
`evals/companion/scenarios` and evaluates them with deterministic Rust rule
judges. The dataset covers persona consistency, memory precision and false
positives, relationship replacement/validity/history, proactive default-off/
quiet-hour/frequency limits, tool confirmation, and control confirmation/
read-only boundaries.

`yunxi eval companion` emits a compact text summary. `--json` emits the full
structured report and `--jsonl` emits one report object for audit tools.
Metrics include explicit correct writes, false positives, missed writes,
forbidden writes, memory precision, recall accuracy, relationship continuity,
proactive boundary violations, tool approval bypasses, and control regression.

The default path has no live provider, external judge, Python runtime, cloud
service, scheduler, or upstream Codex dependency. Scenario/result schemas and
golden thresholds are small reviewable files; no generated result snapshots are
committed.

## YunXi Agent v1.9.3 Companion UX & Controls

v1.9.3 adds shared `ControlRequest`, `ControlScope`, `ControlVerb`,
`ControlSnapshot`, and audit/history facade types in `yunxi-agent-core`.
`yunxi-agent-runtime::control_snapshot` derives one read-only view from current
configuration, persisted persona settings, transparent memory records, and
Relationship Graph Lite. CLI and TUI consume that same snapshot.

The CLI exposes `yunxi controls ...` plus companion-specific status/on/off/
history/clear commands. Local companion state persists in the existing persona
settings file. Future cloud control is represented separately, remains false
by default, and has no network or service dependency. Persona and relationship
views remain read-only.

The TUI renders the shared snapshot as a status-focused controls panel. Its
interactive `/controls clear companion|memory` path opens an explicit input
confirmation and requires the scope-specific `CLEAR ...` token. Scripted CLI
clear operations require `--confirm`. Workspace memory clear retains the
append-only model by archiving active/pending records; companion clear affects
only the local companion history ledger.

All show, refresh, enable, disable, update, clear, rejected-clear, and legacy
persona/memory control mutations append JSONL audit records under
`<workspace>/.yunxi/controls/audit.jsonl`. Runtime companion plans append a
separate privacy-bounded `companion-history.jsonl` record containing trigger,
reason, message, and confirmation flag. No scheduler, cloud backend, desktop
app, web console, SDK, marketplace, or upstream Codex dependency was added.

## YunXi Agent v1.9.2 Proactive Companion Loop

The current workspace version is v1.9.2. `yunxi-agent-companion` is a pure Rust
policy crate with no scheduler, cloud service, Python runtime, or background
process. `AgentConfig.companion` is disabled by default and carries quiet-hour,
per-session, per-day, reason, and tool-confirmation controls.

The runtime calls the planner only at a turn boundary when an explicit
companion signal is present. Plans include a bounded reason. Tool-related plans
are confirmation messages and never enter `ToolRouter` automatically. The
Relationship Graph Lite is consumed only as a read-only relationship signal.

Covered regression paths include default-off behavior, reminder, unfinished
task, long-idle, topic continuation, periodic summary, relationship signal,
quiet hours, frequency limits, reason visibility, and tool confirmation.

## Current Stage

The repository currently contains:

- A standalone Rust workspace
- `yunxi-agent-core` facade types
- A dry-run `Agent` runner
- The v1.9.1 `yunxi-agent-cli` terminal product, including one-shot, plain
  interactive, JSON/JSONL, and TUI paths
- A `yunxi-agent-codex` integration crate for upstream Codex headless runtime
- YunXi-owned runtime boundary crates:
  - `yunxi-agent-runtime`
  - `yunxi-agent-provider`
  - `yunxi-agent-tools`
  - `yunxi-agent-storage`
- A YunXi-owned persona and transparent memory boundary crate:
  - `yunxi-agent-persona`
- A vendored Codex Rust workspace snapshot at `vendor/codex-rs`
- A `CodexSource` boundary retained for source-shape checks and future refresh
  tooling

## YunXi Agent v1.9.1 Relationship Graph Lite

YunXi Agent v1.9.1 adds a Rust-native, derived relationship graph over Memory
Schema v3 while preserving Persona Context Blocks, the L0-L3 pipeline, and the
v1.9.0 Boot Context/Dynamic Recall split.

Constructed in this slice:

- `RelationshipGraphLite`, `MemoryGraphNode`, `MemoryGraphEdge`, and
  `MemoryGraphRelation` derive nodes and temporal relation edges directly from
  append-only `MemoryRecord` data; no new database or external runtime is used.
- Event order follows event, observed, updated, then created time. Active views
  enforce status, valid-from, expiry, invalidation, and supersession.
- Active preference/correction changes append an updated old fact and a new
  fact with bidirectional `superseded_by`/`supersedes` linkage. Historical JSONL
  lines remain intact.
- Boot Context rejects superseded old facts. Relationship/emotion/change/
  before/after timeline queries use time-ordered Dynamic Recall and expose safe
  relation plus temporal explanation metadata.
- Pending and high-sensitivity conflict candidates remain non-active; recall
  explanations never contain raw memory content.
- All 12 required v1.9.1 test names are present. The Relationship Graph suite
  additionally covers pending conflict explanations, for 11/11 passing graph
  integration tests.

Unified verification completed on 2026-07-17 after the construction batch:

- `cargo fmt`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test`, and
  `cargo check --workspace`: pass.
- Persona: 72 integration tests pass, including graph/time/history,
  supersession, Schema v3, L0-L3, Boot/Dynamic, privacy, compiler, extraction,
  and policy regressions.
- Storage: 5 unit and 22 integration tests pass. Runtime: 1 unit and 41
  integration tests pass. CLI: 22 binary unit, 40 CLI integration, and 10
  JSONL tests pass.
- The isolated public-facade timeline tests return relationship events in
  descending event/observed/update/create order. CLI black-box language change
  emits `supersession_chain`, retains the old record, activates only the new
  record, and leaves no false pending candidate.
- Release build passes; both binaries return `yunxi 1.9.1`.
- All required test names are present; owned-source secret-shape scan reports
  zero matching files; stale v1.9.0 crate-version scan reports zero matches;
  `git diff --check` passes with line-ending warnings only.
- `codegraph sync .` and `codegraph status .`: pass; the index is up to date
  with 1,171 files, 45,222 nodes, and 146,953 edges before the final docs-only
  status writeback.

One CLI regression initially expected the v1.8.x pending-conflict behavior for
an explicit active Chinese-to-English language change. The v1.9.1 report
requires supersession, and the runtime already emitted the correct chain; the
test was updated to assert old-record retention plus bidirectional linkage, and
the complete verification gate then passed.

After explicit user confirmation, the validated release binaries were copied
to `C:\Users\24763\AppData\Local\YunXi Agent\bin`. Both installed binaries
return `yunxi 1.9.1`. The directory was already present in user PATH, so no
duplicate PATH entry was written. Final `cargo clean` removed 13,133 files
(about 3.6 GiB), and the repository `target` directory is absent.

Release publication completed through the GitHub Git Data REST API without
force. The release commit is
`e9c14152e8e4b96b12fecd56f93063a3dcd90a8b`, its tree is
`4029ffcc6e7fcb0dcd0a4985c1490c3836c706f4`, and annotated tag object
`efd1302eff252b2aae0f0e4637c37e9401a4e8f0` is referenced by immutable
`v1.9.1` and resolves to that release commit. GitHub reports 29 tags. The prior
`v1.9.0` and `v1.8.9` tag objects remain respectively
`2625358b36861811912e4c2be2671b0db04ff5db` and
`3ab5c70dc3edc69583fa863412c1b4d454bd6f29`; neither was deleted, moved, or
rewritten. This publication record is committed as a docs-only audit change
after the immutable release tag.

## YunXi Agent v1.9.0 Boot Context And Recall Router

YunXi Agent v1.9.0 adds a Rust-native two-route recall boundary while
preserving the v1.8.7 Persona Context Blocks, v1.8.8 Memory Schema v3, and
v1.8.9 L0-L3 Memory Pipeline contracts.

Constructed in this slice:

- `MemoryRecallRouter` selects stable, privacy-allowed global, relationship,
  agent, and matching-workspace records into a first-turn Boot Context with an
  independent 1,000-character/six-record default budget.
- Prompt/recent-turn-relevant Dynamic Recall remains active on every turn with
  an independent 1,200-character/eight-record default budget, a bounded
  recent-context query input, and no always-on preference shortcut.
- Dedup runs before routing; a dedup key selected for Boot Context is excluded
  from Dynamic Recall.
- `MemoryRecallExplanation` exposes route, score, selected state, fixed reason,
  safe source category, layer, scope, and kind without raw memory content.
- New sessions compile stable `boot_memory_context` and
  `dynamic_memory_context` blocks. Resume turns skip Boot Context. Both blocks
  retain context-not-instruction and higher-priority policy notices.
- Runtime emits separate `memory_recall` summaries for `scope=boot` and
  `scope=dynamic`; event queries remain secret-redacted and memory content is
  not emitted.
- No relationship graph, proactive loop, database/vector/graph service,
  external memory runtime, cloud, marketplace, SDK, evaluation harness, or TUI
  memory inspector was added.

Unified verification completed after the construction batch:

- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo check --workspace`: pass.
- Persona: 61 integration tests pass, including all 12 required named v1.9.0
  coverage points across router, runtime, compiler, Schema v3, and L0-L3
  regression suites.
- Storage: 5 unit and 21 integration tests pass. Runtime: 1 unit and 41
  integration tests pass. CLI: 22 binary unit, 40 CLI integration, and 10
  JSONL tests pass.
- Release build passes; both binaries return `yunxi 1.9.0`.
- Isolated black-box passes: new-session Boot selects two records while Dynamic
  is deduplicated to zero; resume skips Boot and dynamically recalls one
  prompt-relevant record.
- Explanation JSON serialization, raw-sensitive-content exclusion, independent
  budgets, Persona Context Blocks, Schema v3, L0-L3 regression, owned-source
  key-shape scan, and `git diff --check`: pass.
- `codegraph sync .` and `codegraph status .`: pass; the current index contains
  1,169 files, 45,164 nodes, and 146,675 edges.

After explicit user confirmation, both binaries were installed under the
user-local YunXi bin directory and returned `yunxi 1.9.0`; the directory was
already present in user PATH, so no duplicate PATH entry was written. The
isolated black-box fixture was removed. After the final recent-turn audit and
release rebuild, the final `cargo clean` removed 9,195 files (about 2.7 GiB).
Publication completed through the GitHub Git Data REST API without force. The
release commit is `4e014314df9c9296b5fb843b13bf390c71f6d4e0`; annotated tag
object `2625358b36861811912e4c2be2671b0db04ff5db` is referenced by `v1.9.0`
and resolves to that commit. GitHub reports 28 tags. The prior `v1.8.9` tag
object remains `3ab5c70dc3edc69583fa863412c1b4d454bd6f29`.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.9 L0-L3 Memory Pipeline

YunXi Agent v1.8.9 moves rule and Provider extraction into a single Rust-native
pipeline while preserving Memory Schema v3 and the v1.8.7 Persona Context
Blocks contract.

Constructed in this slice:

- L0 records a bounded, secret-aware raw-turn evidence summary and never emits
  a durable instruction candidate.
- L1 emits structured preference, personal fact, goal, project context, and
  correction candidates.
- L2 emits relationship, emotional, and event candidates as `pending` by
  default.
- L3 promotes only explicit, stable, low-risk, high-confidence, clearly sourced
  facts after cross-source dedup; it does not create a duplicate durable fact.
- Rule and Provider candidates share policy, source-lineage merge, dedup, and
  append-only storage. Invalid Provider JSON is fail-soft and leaves rule
  candidates intact.
- Sensitive content is downgraded to confirmation; secret-like content and raw
  evidence are redacted and discarded before durable persistence.
- Runtime memory events retain summary-only metadata and do not print candidate
  memory content.
- No database, vector/graph service, Python/JavaScript runtime, external memory
  dependency, Boot Context/Recall Router, proactive loop, TUI inspector, cloud,

The development report is recorded in

Publication uses the GitHub Git Data REST API with a non-force `master` update
and a new annotated `v1.8.9` tag. Earlier tags are not deleted, moved, or
rewritten. Exact immutable Git object ids and installation/cleanup evidence are
recorded in the external timestamped development log because a commit cannot
contain its own content-derived object id.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.8 Memory Schema v3

YunXi Agent v1.8.8 extends the transparent append-only JSONL memory boundary
with a structured schema for a general companion agent. The default runtime
still depends only on YunXi-owned Rust crates and does not add a database,
vector/graph service, Python/JavaScript runtime, or external memory package.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace, CLI, TUI, built-in persona profile, tests, README, and installer
  documentation are promoted to `1.8.8`; durable records now write
  `schema_version = 3`.
- `MemoryRecord` adds layer, typed entity references, temporal validity,
  bounded evidence, primary source plus attribution lineage, and explicit
  supersede/conflict/expiry/invalidation metadata. Existing confidence,
  importance, source session, dedup, revision, and merged-count fields remain.
- Current v3 records receive semantic defaults. v2 and v1 records migrate in
  memory on read, missing-schema v1 records retain their warning, and future
  schemas remain warning-and-skip. Loading does not rewrite JSONL.
- Rule/provider candidate evidence is mapped at the shared dedup boundary.
  Secret-like evidence is replaced by a fixed redaction notice instead of
  being copied into durable memory.
- Dedup keys remain based on scope, kind, and normalized content, preserving
  historical slots. Merge unions evidence, entities, source attribution,
  invalidation relations, revision, and merged count.
- Recall, active storage views, and Persona Context Blocks exclude records
  outside their validity window or marked invalidated/superseded, in addition
  to the existing status filters.
- The v1.8.7 Persona Context Blocks contract remains structurally stable:
  `memory_context role="context_not_instruction"`, escaping, priority notices,
  block ordering, and budget behavior are retained under version `1.8.8`.
- Read-only external reference review covered memU stable content dedup,
  nocturne_memory version-chain semantics, and yantrikdb tombstone/revision
  audit behavior. No reference source was modified or added as a dependency.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-17-153715-yunxi-agent-v1-8-8-memory-schema-v3-development-report.md`.

Unified verification completed after the construction batch:

- `cargo fmt` and `cargo fmt --check`: pass.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-persona`: pass; 38 integration tests, including
  all 10 required Memory Schema v3 tests and 4 Persona Context Blocks tests.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-storage`: pass; 5 unit and 21 integration tests,
  including mixed v1/v2/v3 append-only JSONL loading without file rewrite.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-runtime`: pass; 40 integration tests.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; both binaries passed 11 unit tests,
  CLI integration passed 40 tests, and JSONL integration passed 10 tests.
- `cargo test`: pass; every workspace unit, integration, and doc test completed
  with zero failures.
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass.
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass.
- Release version checks: pass; both binaries returned `yunxi 1.8.8`.
- Isolated memory CLI smoke under `target\v1.8.8-smoke`: list/show/search/
  pending passed; approve produced active, reject produced rejected, delete
  produced archived, and every durable record reported schema v3.
- Owned-source secret scan excluding generated/upstream/build/report paths:
  pass; no live key-shaped match files.
- `git diff --check`: pass; only expected Windows LF-to-CRLF notices appeared.
- `codegraph sync .`: pass; already up to date.
- `codegraph status .`: pass; 1,165 files, 45,052 nodes, and 146,173 edges.

- `scripts\install\install-yunxi.ps1 -AddToPath -SkipBuild`: pass; both
  binaries copied to `C:\Users\24763\AppData\Local\YunXi Agent\bin`.
  Direct installed-binary and PATH command checks returned `yunxi 1.8.8`;
  the user PATH contained the install directory exactly once and required no
  duplicate update.
- `cargo clean`: pass after explicit confirmation; 19,120 files and about
  3.2 GiB (3,451,338,167 measured bytes) were removed. The repository
  `target` directory, including isolated smoke data, no longer exists.

Pre-publication GitHub REST API checks passed: remote `master` matched local and
`origin/master` at `270e836b983141e2654568e4b07aed006a16bb27`, remote
`v1.8.8` was absent, and all 25 earlier local tags remained available.

The verified staged tree is published through the GitHub Git Data REST API as
`Release YunXi Agent v1.8.8 Memory Schema v3`, using a non-force `master` ref
update and a new annotated `v1.8.8` tag pointing at the same release commit.
Earlier tags are not deleted, moved, or rewritten. The exact resulting commit
and tag object ids are recorded in the external timestamped development log,
because a commit cannot include its own content-derived object id.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.7 Persona Context Blocks

YunXi Agent v1.8.7 upgrades the persona compiler from loose line-oriented text
to stable, XML-like context blocks while leaving the runtime injection contract
narrow: runtime continues to consume only `CompiledPersonaContext.content`.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace, CLI, TUI, built-in persona profile, tests, README, and installer
  documentation are promoted to `1.8.7`.
- `PersonaPromptCompiler` renders `persona`, `boundaries`, `human`,
  `relationship`, and `memory_context` blocks in a stable order beneath a
  versioned `yunxi_persona_context` wrapper.
- Text and attribute values receive dependency-free XML-style escaping before
  rendering, preventing persona, human, relationship, constraint, and memory
  content from breaking structural tags.
- Required boundary lines state that project instructions, the current user
  request, sandbox/privacy/safety/tool policies, and tool execution boundaries
  override persona and memory context.
- Memory is explicitly marked as context rather than instruction, policy, or
  authorization. The compiler independently filters non-active memories.
- Budget handling keeps structural tags and safety notices intact, removes
  optional content by priority with memory entries first, and emits stable
  per-section truncation markers. A 1,000-character floor protects the required
  structural/safety envelope; the default remains 1,800 characters.
- Memory-only runtime injection now delegates to the persona compiler and uses
  the same structured, escaped, active-only rendering boundary.
- Regression tests cover version and block order, safety wording, escaping,
  well-formed budget truncation, memory-only mode, and exclusion of pending,
  rejected, and archived records.
- External reference review was read-only: OpenPersona contributed the layered
  identity/behavior/capability and monotonic-safety model; Letta contributed
  labelled, bounded context-block rendering concepts. No JS/Python package or
  external runtime dependency was introduced.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-17-144543-yunxi-agent-v1-8-7-persona-context-blocks-development-report.md`.

Unified verification was completed after the full construction batch:

- `cargo fmt`: pass.
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-persona`: pass; 28 integration tests passed,
  including 4 Persona Context Blocks regressions.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-runtime`: pass; 40 integration tests passed.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; both binaries passed 11 unit tests,
  CLI integration passed 40 tests, and JSONL integration passed 10 tests.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-tui`: pass; 52 tests passed.
- `cargo test`: pass; all workspace unit, integration, and doc tests completed
  with zero failures.
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass.
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass.
- Release version checks: pass; both release binaries returned `yunxi 1.8.7`.
- Isolated `YUNXI_HOME` JSON/JSONL smoke: pass; JSON produced 21 events and
  JSONL produced 21 lines, with the respective camelCase/snake_case persona
  context injection event present.
- Owned-source secret scan excluding generated/upstream/build directories:
  pass; no live key-shaped match files.
- `git diff --check`: pass; only expected Windows LF-to-CRLF notices appeared.
- `codegraph sync .`: pass; the index was already current.
- `codegraph status .`: pass; the index is up to date with 1,164 files,
  44,997 nodes, and 145,977 edges.
- `scripts\install\install-yunxi.ps1 -AddToPath -SkipBuild`: binaries copied
  successfully to the user-local install directory. Direct installed-binary
  checks both returned `yunxi 1.8.7`; the user PATH entry was then normalized,
  written once, and verified.
- `cargo clean`: pass; 17,894 files and approximately 2.9 GiB
  (3,156,749,840 measured bytes) were removed, and the workspace `target`
  directory no longer exists.

The source, documentation, verification, installation, and cleanup portions
of the v1.8.7 slice are complete. Commit, GitHub REST API publication, and the
new immutable annotated `v1.8.7` tag are recorded after release publication.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.6 JSON Output Redaction

YunXi Agent v1.8.6 fixes the v1.8.5 audit finding that one-shot `--json`
agent execution output could still print secret-like prompt fragments through
raw `AgentRunResult` serialization. The release treats both JSON and JSONL
agent execution output as machine-readable redaction boundaries while keeping
memory write policy unchanged.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.6`.
- The CLI `--json` branch now redacts `AgentRunResult` before pretty JSON
  serialization.
- `AgentRunResult.final_response`, `AgentEvent::Started.prompt`,
  `AgentEvent::Message.content`, memory recall query text, command/tool text,
  provider/error/warning text, todo text, child-agent text, and state `data`
  maps now share the CLI output redaction boundary.
- JSONL redaction now also sanitizes `RuntimeEvent::ThreadState.data`, matching
  the existing `TurnState.data` behavior.
- CLI black-box tests cover fake secret prompt redaction in `--json`, memory
  `action=discard`, and ordinary non-secret prompt preservation.
- Unit tests cover structured `AgentRunResult` redaction and JSONL
  `ThreadState.data` redaction.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-14-yunxi-agent-v1-8-6-json-output-redaction-development-report.md`.

Unified verification was completed after construction, following the project
hard constraint. Results for this slice:

- `cargo fmt`: pass.
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-cli json --test cli_tests`: pass; 11 tests
  passed, including JSON and JSONL secret-like prompt regressions.
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-cli jsonl --test jsonl_tests`: pass; 9 tests
  passed and 1 non-matching test was filtered out.
- Targeted persona/storage/runtime/cli/tui package tests: pass; CLI integration
  tests 40 passed, JSONL integration tests 10 passed, persona tests 25 passed,
  runtime tests 40 passed, storage tests 25 passed, and TUI tests 52 passed.
- `cargo test`: pass; all workspace unit, integration, and doc tests completed
  with zero failures.
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass.
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass.
- Release version checks: pass; both `yunxi.exe` and
  `yunxi-agent-cli.exe` returned `yunxi 1.8.6`.
- Isolated `YUNXI_HOME` JSON and JSONL black-box privacy checks: pass; each
  produced 23 structured events/lines, the fake secret was absent,
  `[redacted]` and `[redacted-sensitive-query]` were present,
  `memory_write action=discard` remained visible, the candidate was not
  persisted, and ordinary non-secret text remained visible.
- Owned-source secret scan excluding generated/upstream/build directories:
  pass; no live key-shaped matches.
- `git diff --check`: pass; only expected Windows LF-to-CRLF notices appeared.
- `codegraph sync .`: pass; the index was already current.
- `codegraph status .`: pass; the index is up to date with 1,164 files,
  44,963 nodes, and 145,840 edges.
- `scripts\install\install-yunxi.ps1 -AddToPath -SkipBuild`: pass; both PATH
  commands returned `yunxi 1.8.6`.
- `cargo clean`: pass; 33,298 files and approximately 5.1 GiB were removed,
  and the workspace `target` directory no longer exists.
- Pre-publish GitHub REST API check: remote `master` remained at the immutable
  v1.8.5 commit and `v1.8.6` did not yet exist, so the verified release tree was
  safe to publish as a new tag without moving earlier tags.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.5 JSONL Redaction

YunXi Agent v1.8.5 fixes the v1.8.4 audit finding that ordinary JSONL
transcript events could print secret-like prompt fragments. The release keeps
the existing memory write policy unchanged and adds a CLI output sanitization
boundary before runtime events are serialized to machine-readable logs.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.5`.
- CLI JSONL output now passes runtime events through a structured redaction
  helper before `to_jsonl_line`.
- User and assistant `item.message.content` fields are sanitized, including
  offline assistant echo text such as `YunXi autonomous runtime accepted
  prompt: ...`.
- Stream items, deltas, tool arguments/output, approval/escalation reasons,
  child-agent messages, nested function-call JSON output, and selected state
  detail maps use the same secret-fragment redaction boundary.
- JSONL redaction remains independent from memory write policy: secret-like
  memory candidates are still discarded rather than persisted.
- CLI black-box tests cover secret-like prompt redaction and memory discard in
  JSONL mode without hard-coding full key-shaped literals.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-14-yunxi-agent-v1-8-5-jsonl-redaction-development-report.md`.

Unified verification was performed after construction according to the project
hard constraint.

Verified in this slice:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass
- CLI JSONL redaction tests: pass; `jsonl_tests` includes 10 passing tests
- memory-enabled JSONL privacy test: pass; secret-like prompt output is
  redacted while memory write emits `action=discard`
- targeted package tests for persona/storage/runtime/cli/tui: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass
- `target\release\yunxi.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.8.5`
- `target\release\yunxi-agent-cli.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.8.5`
- isolated `YUNXI_HOME` black-box JSONL privacy check: pass; fake secret was
  absent from JSONL, `[redacted]`, `[redacted-sensitive-query]`, and
  `memory_write action=discard` were present
- `git diff --check`: pass
- owned-source secret scan: pass; no live key-shaped matches
- `codegraph sync .`: pass; 9 changed files synced
- `codegraph status .`: pass; index is up to date
- install refresh with `scripts\install\install-yunxi.ps1 -AddToPath
  -SkipBuild`: pass
- PATH smoke: pass; `yunxi --version` and `yunxi-agent-cli --version` both
  returned `yunxi 1.8.5`

## YunXi Agent v1.8.4 English Memory Preference And Audit Fix

YunXi Agent v1.8.4 fixes the v1.8.3 audit findings around English language
preference extraction and memory source audit semantics. The release stays
inside the JSONL transparent memory layer and does not add SQLite, vector
search, graph memory, relationship state machines, or new TUI memory UI.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.4`.
- Rule extraction now recognizes English language preferences in Chinese and
  English phrasing, including `以后请用英文回答`, `以后请用英语回答`,
  `Please answer in English from now on`, `reply in English from now on`, and
  `use English by default`.
- English rule candidates normalize to
  `global_user|preference|language:en`.
- Chinese and English language preferences remain distinct dedup slots while
  sharing the same language conflict family, so an active Chinese preference
  followed by an English preference routes the English candidate to pending
  review.
- `promote_incoming` now uses the incoming `source_session_id`, aligning the
  single-field audit trail with the final promoted content.
- `preserve_existing` and `combine_non_conflicting` keep the existing source as
  the preferred single source until a future schema can represent multi-source
  provenance.
- CLI black-box tests cover offline/rule-only English memory writes and
  Chinese/English conflict pending.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-14-yunxi-agent-v1-8-4-english-memory-preference-development-report.md`.

Unified verification was performed after construction according to the project
hard constraint.

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- targeted package tests for persona/storage/runtime/cli/tui: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass
- `target\release\yunxi.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.8.4`
- `target\release\yunxi-agent-cli.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.8.4`
- isolated `YUNXI_HOME` English memory write: pass; JSONL emitted
  `memory_candidate` and `memory_write action=auto_saved`, and global memory
  contained `global_user|preference|language:en`
- isolated `YUNXI_HOME` language conflict: pass; English preference after
  active Chinese preference entered pending with
  `merge_strategy=conflict_requires_confirmation`, while active
  `global_user|preference|language:zh` was preserved
- `git diff --check`: pass
- owned-source secret scan: pass; no live key-shaped matches
- `codegraph sync .`: pass; 11 changed Rust files synced
- `codegraph status .`: pass; index is up to date
- install refresh with `scripts\install\install-yunxi.ps1 -AddToPath
  -SkipBuild`: pass
- PATH smoke: pass; `yunxi --version` and `yunxi-agent-cli --version` both
  returned `yunxi 1.8.4`

## YunXi Agent v1.8.3 Memory Merge Fidelity

YunXi Agent v1.8.3 hardens the v1.8.2 transparent memory layer by preserving
rich memory content during same-slot merges. The release keeps JSONL
append-only storage and does not add SQLite, vector search, graph memory, or a
TUI memory inspector.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.3`.
- Added persona memory merge fidelity logic with explicit merge strategies:
  `preserve_existing`, `promote_incoming`, `combine_non_conflicting`, and
  `conflict_requires_confirmation`.
- Batch dedup now uses the same merge fidelity path as storage, so provider and
  rule candidates in the same turn do not discard richer memory content.
- Storage `append_or_merge` no longer uses incoming records as the unconditional
  merged base; it preserves durable ids and revision ledger while selecting the
  richer content.
- Language preference conflicts, such as active Chinese followed by English,
  now route the incoming candidate to pending review instead of overwriting the
  active preference.
- Runtime Auto memory extraction folds provider and rule candidates together
  before deduplication.
- `memory_write` diagnostics can expose `merge_strategy` and `conflict_family`
  without exposing memory content.
- TUI memory notices stay short while debug/details retain merge diagnostics.
- `docs/persona-memory.md` documents merge fidelity, provider/rule mixed
  scenarios, and conflict pending behavior.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-14-yunxi-agent-v1-8-3-memory-merge-fidelity-development-report.md`.

Unified verification is intentionally deferred until construction is complete,
following the project hard constraint.

Planned verification for this slice:

- `cargo fmt`
- `cargo fmt --check`
- targeted package tests for persona/storage/runtime/cli/tui
- `cargo test`
- `cargo check --workspace`
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`
- release binary version checks for `yunxi 1.8.3`
- isolated `YUNXI_HOME` black-box memory merge fidelity checks
- `git diff --check`
- `codegraph sync .`
- `codegraph status .`

## YunXi Agent v1.8.2 Memory Deduplication, Migration, And Diagnostics

YunXi Agent v1.8.2 hardens the v1.8.1 persona and transparent memory layer.
The release keeps JSONL append-only storage and does not add SQLite, vector
search, graph memory, or a TUI memory inspector.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.2`.
- Memory schema is promoted to v2 with `dedup_key`, `revision`, and
  `merged_count`.
- Rule and provider candidates share batch deduplication for equivalent
  language preferences and other normalized memory content.
- Storage writes use `append_or_merge`, preserving append-only revisions while
  merging equivalent active/pending records before they multiply.
- v1 and legacy no-version JSONL records migrate to v2 on read; future schema
  and corrupt JSONL lines produce warnings without panics.
- Latest memory view and recall both defensively collapse duplicate active
  records before prompt budgeting.
- `memory_recall` JSONL events now expose `always_on_count`,
  `dropped_unrelated`, `dropped_by_budget`, and `dropped_duplicates`.
- CLI adds `--memory-extraction <auto|rule-only|provider>`.
- Provider-backed extraction now distinguishes valid JSON, invalid JSON, empty
  candidates, timeout, rule-only, and provider-required modes.
- TUI memory notices use short user-facing wording while debug/details retain
  id, scope, kind, status, action, revision, merged_count, and recall counts.
- `docs/persona-memory.md` documents v2 schema, dedup, migration, recall
  diagnostics, provider extraction modes, and TUI notice wording.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-14-yunxi-agent-v1-8-2-memory-dedup-migration-diagnostics-development-report.md`.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.1 Persona Memory Correctness And Transparency Hardening

YunXi Agent v1.8.1 hardens the v1.8.0 persona and transparent memory foundation
after source audit. It keeps the same local JSONL architecture and does not add
SQLite, vector search, graph memory, or a TUI memory inspector.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.1`.
- Added semantic memory scope routing so language/general interaction
  preferences are global user memories, while project hard constraints remain
  workspace-scoped.
- Added recall relevance gating and a small always-on profile budget for global
  language/interaction preferences.
- Fixed pending workflow consistency by basing `memory pending` on the latest
  full-record state instead of pending JSONL files alone.
- Updated `memory clear --workspace --confirm` to archive workspace active and
  pending records and report active/pending summary counts.
- Added provider-backed structured memory candidate extraction with timeout,
  rule fallback, and write-policy enforcement.
- Added first-enable disclosure fields for `yunxi memory on`, including storage
  roots and pending policy summary.
- Aligned prompt order to AGENTS/persona+memory/mentioned files/restored
  history/current user prompt.
- Made TUI memory write transparency events visible without exposing memory
  content.
- Hardened TUI composer display-width and height calculations for CJK and long
  tokens.

The development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-13-yunxi-agent-v1-8-1-persona-memory-correctness-transparency-development-report.md`.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.0 Persona And Transparent Memory Construction

YunXi Agent v1.8.0 introduces the first persona and transparent memory
foundation. The project baseline is v1.7.8, which already has the autonomous
terminal runtime, provider/tool/storage/session chain, TUI, sandbox policy
honesty, JSON/JSONL surfaces, and REST API release/tag workflow.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.8.0`.
- Added the YunXi-owned `yunxi-agent-persona` crate.
- Added the built-in `yunxi_companion_strong` persona profile.
- Added a persona prompt compiler with clear priority below AGENTS.md and user hard
  constraints
- Added global and workspace JSONL memory records.
- Added pending/approve/reject/delete/off/on memory controls.
- Added turn-start recall with prompt budget limits.
- Added turn-end memory candidate extraction with rule fallback.
- Added privacy-first write policy where sensitive or long-term profile facts require
  confirmation
- Added persona/memory summary events for CLI JSONL, plain rendering, and TUI
  debug detail without printing full memory content.
- Documented schema, paths, CLI, and privacy rules in `docs/persona-memory.md`.

v1.8.0 does not add SQLite, vector search, graph memory, complex relationship
state machines, proactive triggers, or a TUI memory inspector. Those remain
future v1.8.1/v1.9/v2.0 topics after the transparent memory foundation is
stable.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.8 Sandbox Schema And Policy Hardening Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.8 keeps the 1.7 series focused on terminal Agent stability and
sandbox honesty. It does not introduce 1.8 new-module work.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.8`.
- `sandbox_attempt` events now carry `schema_version`, `backend_id`, and
  `backend_label` in addition to the compatibility `backend` string.
- `enforcement` is the canonical machine field. `enforcement_level` remains as
  a compatibility alias and is kept equal to `enforcement`.
- Windows workspace-write/read-only attempts continue to report
  `backend_id=windows_process_lifecycle`, `enforcement=process_lifecycle`,
  `runner=windows_process_lifecycle`, `os_isolation=false`, and a non-empty
  `unsupported_reason`.
- `danger-full-access` attempts are explicitly visible as
  `backend_id=direct_process_policy_bypass`, `enforcement=policy_bypass`, and
  `os_isolation=false`.
- Tool runtime policy diagnostics now use the same adjusted `ExecutionPolicy`
  for decision and runner diagnostic generation, including workspace root.
- Acceptance tests cover schema fields, disabled-network command detection,
  danger-full-access bypass visibility, and policy-gated behavior across shell,
  patch, MCP, skill, multi-agent, tool search, view image, and user-input tool
  entries.
- `docs/protocol/sandbox-events.md` records the v1 schema and current Windows
  boundary without claiming OS-enforced filesystem isolation.

Verification for this slice was performed only after construction, following
the project hard constraint to avoid repeated mid-construction test loops.

Verified in this slice:

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- targeted package tests for sandbox/tools/exec/runtime/tui/cli: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass
- release binary version smoke: `yunxi 1.7.8`
- offline plain/JSON/JSONL smoke: pass
- fixture JSONL schema smoke: pass; 7 `sandbox_attempt` events carried
  `schema_version=1`, `backend_id`, `backend_label`, canonical `enforcement`,
  matching `enforcement_level`, `runner`, and `os_isolation=false`
- DeepSeek live JSONL and JSON smoke: pass; model returned `OK`, and output did
  not leak the local credential
- dependency and owned-source secret scans: pass
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only
- `codegraph sync` and `codegraph status`: pass
- install helper and PATH smoke: pass

## Stage 4A Runtime Boundary

Stage 4A introduces a YunXi-owned autonomous runtime boundary.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-runtime` owns the first YunXi runtime backend implementation.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` owns provider request/response interfaces and a
  deterministic `StaticProvider`.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns tool request/response interfaces, shell/patch/MCP
  runtime plumbing, approval decisions, and sandbox diagnostic runtime events.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` owns session records and an in-memory session store.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` defaults to `--backend yunxi`.
- `--backend dry-run` remains available for deterministic smoke checks.
  `--backend codex` is no longer exposed as a default CLI backend; the detached
  Codex compatibility path lives in `yunxi-agent-codex`.
- `--live` selects live provider mode and no longer implies the detached Codex
  backend.

The `yunxi` backend emits YunXi `AgentEvent` values directly and does not depend
on `vendor/codex-rs`. The Codex backend remains as an explicit compatibility
path while provider/tool/storage behavior is migrated in later slices.

## Next Stage

Stage 4C should turn the independent default runtime into a practical
YunXi-owned agent by adding a real provider adapter, approval/sandbox policy,
constrained patch support, and session CLI commands. The development report is
recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4c-provider-policy-runtime-report.md`.

## Stage 4C Provider, Policy, Patch, And Session Slice

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-provider` owns OpenAI-compatible provider configuration,
  request serialization, response parsing, auth source resolution, and
  fixture-backed completion.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns explicit approval and sandbox policy mapping from
  `AgentConfig` before tool execution.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns constrained patch operations for write and delete,
  with rejection of absolute paths and parent-directory traversal.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` maps provider-requested shell, patch, MCP, and skill
  calls into policy-carrying YunXi tool requests.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` emits provider turn reasoning, tool completion,
  warning, patch, command, MCP, and file-change events through YunXi event
  types.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` can list and inspect file-backed sessions through
  `sessions list` and `sessions show`.

  `yunxi-agent-codex`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or `codex-*` crates
- disabled-vendor verification: pass after temporarily renaming
  `vendor/codex-rs` to `vendor/codex-rs.disabled`
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4D Planned Direction

The next stage is Codex core agent parity extraction. Its goal is to replicate
the Codex CLI headless Agent core capabilities in YunXi-owned crates while
keeping the default YunXi runtime independent from `vendor/codex-rs` and
`codex-*` crates.

The Stage 4D development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4d-codex-core-agent-parity-report.md`.

Stage 4D implementation has started with the first parity foundation slice:

- `docs/extraction-index/codex-core-agent-parity-map.md` maps Codex core agent
  source files to YunXi-owned target crates.
- `yunxi-agent-protocol` owns provider/runtime input, response, tool-call, and
  JSONL event protocol types.
- `yunxi-agent-context` owns the first AGENTS.md hierarchy loader and context
  bundle facade.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` owns approval, sandbox, cwd, and network policy
  decision types.
- `yunxi-agent-exec` owns command canonicalization and output aggregation
  primitives.
- `yunxi-agent-patch` owns constrained JSON patch and Codex-style
  `*** Begin Patch` application.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` owns MCP configuration, resource, and tool invocation
  interfaces.
- `yunxi-agent-skills` owns skill discovery, metadata, and invocation
  interfaces.
- `yunxi-agent-multi-agent` owns multi-agent command and registry interfaces.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` now loads workspace `AGENTS.md` instructions into the
  provider message stream.
- `yunxi-agent-cli parity map` prints the Codex core parity migration map.

Stage 4D full parity is not complete yet. The current slice establishes the
autonomous YunXi-owned module boundaries needed to continue mechanical
migration from `vendor/codex-rs` without adding upstream crate dependencies.

Stage 4D foundation verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- package checks for `yunxi-agent-core`, `yunxi-agent-protocol`,

- disabled-vendor verification: pass after temporarily renaming
  `vendor/codex-rs` to `vendor/codex-rs.disabled`
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4F Dynamic Tool Autonomy Slice

This slice turns a first group of migrated Codex core dynamic-tool surfaces into
YunXi-owned runtime behavior instead of schema-only placeholders.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns `CompositeToolRuntime`, which keeps shell, patch,
  tool search, image inspection, and host-input behavior while dispatching MCP,
  skill, and multi-agent requests to YunXi-owned runtimes.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` defaults to `CompositeToolRuntime`, so provider-emitted
  MCP, skill, and multi-agent tool calls can execute through the default YunXi
  backend.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` can load an in-memory MCP runtime seed from a project-local
  JSON file, enabling workspace-owned MCP server/tool/resource fixtures without
  depending on upstream Codex source.
- Default composite MCP execution checks `.yunxi/mcp-runtime.json` in the
  current workspace before falling back to an injected MCP runtime.
- Skill execution discovers workspace skills from `.codex/skills`,
  `.yunxi/skills`, and `skills`, then returns the selected `SKILL.md`
  instruction payload through the tool result channel.
- Multi-agent execution supports spawn, wait, send-message, follow-up,
  interrupt, and list actions through `yunxi-agent-multi-agent`'s in-memory
  registry.
- Runtime tests cover provider-requested MCP, skill, and multi-agent tool calls
  flowing through the autonomous YunXi backend.

Stage 4F verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; default tree contains no
  `yunxi-agent-codex`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or `codex-*` crates
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4G Planned Direction

The next stage is the full core Agent parity one-pass build. Its goal is to
turn the remaining migrated Codex CLI headless Agent sources into YunXi-owned
runtime behavior across protocol streaming, live provider transport, exec,
sandbox/approval, patch, context, MCP, skills/plugins, multi-agent, storage,
rollout, resume, and CLI JSONL parity.

The Stage 4G development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4g-full-core-agent-parity-one-pass-development-report.md`.

## Stage 4G First Construction Slice

Stage 4G implementation has started with the protocol, provider, exec, approval,
and runtime event foundation needed by the larger one-pass parity build.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-protocol` now carries tool output deltas, response cancellation,
  and approval requested/completed runtime events.
- `yunxi-agent-core` exposes approval requested/completed agent events with
  stable JSON names.
- `yunxi-agent-exec` can build an `ExecTrace` from a completed shell execution,
  including started, stdout/stderr delta, and completed lifecycle events.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` attaches exec lifecycle events to `ToolResponse` for shell
  execution.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` emits approval lifecycle events for approval-blocked
  tools and maps exec lifecycle output deltas into command update events.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` maps command output deltas and approval lifecycle events into
  protocol JSONL runtime events.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` extends provider config with timeout, streaming, and
  capability metadata controlling tools, parallel tool calls, reasoning, and
  stream usage.

Stage 4G first construction verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; default tree contains no
  `yunxi-agent-codex`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or `codex-*` crates
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4G Exec Manager Runtime Slice

This slice turns the first Stage 4G exec foundation into default YunXi runtime
behavior.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-exec` owns an async `ExecManager` that spawns platform shell
  commands, writes optional stdin, captures stdout/stderr, enforces timeout
  limits, kills timed-out processes, records lifecycle events, and returns an
  `ExecTrace`.
- `yunxi-agent-exec` now depends on workspace `tokio` with `io-util` and
  `time` features so process I/O and timeout handling live in the YunXi-owned
  exec crate.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` routes shell execution through `ExecManager` instead of
  direct `process.output()`, so the default tool runtime consumes the shared
  exec lifecycle path.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` renders non-empty tool output/errors first, then falls
  back to structured failed/declined messages when shell output is empty.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` emits useful warnings for failed shell tools, including
  exit-code-only failures, while avoiding duplicate warnings for cancelled exec
  lifecycle events.
- Tests cover stdin capture, timeout cancellation, non-zero shell exit status,
  and runtime propagation of failed shell tool output.

Stage 4G exec manager runtime verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; default tree contains no
  `yunxi-agent-codex`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or `codex-*` crates
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4G Sandbox Approval Escalation Slice

This slice turns migrated sandbox, approval, and escalation policy primitives
into default YunXi runtime behavior.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` evaluates approval, sandbox, cwd, command-risk, and
  network policy in one `PolicyEvaluation`.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` records explicit `ApprovalRequest` and
  `EscalationRequest` details, including required sandbox or network policy
  changes for blocked commands.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` stores the full policy evaluation in
  `ToolDispatchTrace`, routes shell, patch, MCP, skill, multi-agent, search,
  image, and host-input requests through the shared evaluation path, and keeps
  low-risk read-only shell commands runnable while blocking write-risk commands.
- `yunxi-agent-core` exposes escalation requested/completed agent events with
  stable JSON names.
- `yunxi-agent-protocol` exposes escalation requested/completed JSONL runtime
  events.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` emits approval and escalation lifecycle events from the
  shared tool dispatch trace instead of relying on string matching against
  declined policy reasons.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` maps escalation lifecycle agent events into protocol JSONL
  runtime events.
- Tests cover read-only sandbox write blocking, network-disabled escalation,
  outside-workspace escalation, stable escalation event names, escalation JSONL
  round-trips, and runtime escalation emission.

Stage 4G sandbox approval escalation verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; default tree contains no
  `yunxi-agent-codex`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or `codex-*` crates
- dependency-tree keyword scan for `codex`, `vendor`, and
  `yunxi-agent-codex`: pass with no matches
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Stage 4H Planned Direction

The next stage is upstream core gap closure. Its goal is to use
`vendor/codex-rs` and `extracted/codex-core-agent-sources` as direct behavior
references and close the remaining Codex CLI headless Agent parity gaps in
YunXi-owned crates, without restoring upstream runtime dependencies.

Stage 4H must follow the project hard constraint: build the remaining capability
surface first, avoid repeated mid-construction validation loops, and run the
full verification gate only after the 12 remaining parity layers are migrated
and wired into the default YunXi runtime.

The Stage 4H development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4h-upstream-core-gap-closure-development-report.md`.

## Stage 4H Gap Closure Construction Slice

Stage 4H construction is in progress and intentionally has not run the final
verification gate yet. This slice extends the YunXi-owned headless runtime
surface without restoring any default upstream Codex runtime dependency.

Constructed in this slice so far:

- `yunxi-agent-provider` builds live/fixture OpenAI-compatible requests from a
  workspace-aware tool registry and parses dynamic `skill__*`, `plugin__*`, and
  `mcp__*` function names back into YunXi-owned tool call variants.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` can export fixed plus workspace-discovered dynamic tools
  as provider function schemas.
- `yunxi-agent-skills` discovers workspace plugins, resolves plugin skill/MCP
  roots, and emits dynamic tool metadata for skills, plugins, and plugin MCP
  seeds.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` maps streamed dynamic function names into skill, MCP,
  or tool-search calls while keeping the provider/model layer replaceable.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` injects mentioned workspace file context from prompts
  such as `@src/lib.rs` into provider messages with bounded file content.
- `yunxi-agent-patch` exposes structured patch diagnostics through
  `PatchDiagnostic`, `PatchApplyError`, and `apply_patch_detailed`.
- Patch execution now returns a failed `ToolResponse` with serialized
  diagnostics for patch failures, allowing the runtime to continue through the
  normal tool failed event path.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` owns an HTTP JSON-RPC client facade with a replaceable
  transport, a reqwest-backed default transport, and fixture transport for
  offline verification.
- `yunxi-agent-multi-agent` owns serializable agent graph session metadata,
  cycle-safe insertion/validation, and graph reconstruction from persisted
  metadata.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` owns a storage-backed session graph view and can export
  persisted session/thread metadata into multi-agent graph metadata.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` exposes stable YunXi exit-code classification and a
  `sessions graph` command for persisted parent/child thread views.
- `tool_search` now returns both workspace file matches and dynamic tool
  metadata discovered from the active workspace.

Stage 4H gap closure construction verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; scan found no `codex`,
  `vendor`, or `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency in the default CLI tree
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only
- `cargo clean`: pass; removed 1.2GiB of build artifacts

## Stage 4I Planned Direction

The next stage is behavior-level core parity closure. Stage 4H moved the main
headless Agent capability surfaces into YunXi-owned crates; Stage 4I should
turn those surfaces into deeper Codex CLI headless core behavior parity without
restoring any upstream runtime dependency.

Stage 4I focuses on the remaining deep gaps:

- true incremental provider SSE consumption
- long-lived MCP session runtime
- platform sandbox runner and escalation boundary
- multi-agent child runtime execution
- full apply_patch boundary parity
- context, compact, rollout, and state reconstruction
- protocol, event, and CLI JSONL full shape
- disabled-vendor parity harness

The Stage 4I development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4i-behavior-level-core-parity-closure-development-report.md`.

## Stage 4I First Construction Slice

Stage 4I implementation has completed the first behavior-level parity
foundation slice. Construction followed the build-first constraint and ran the
full verification gate only after the slice was wired.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-provider` now owns an incremental SSE decoder,
  `ProviderStreamChunk`, and `OpenAiStreamAccumulator` so provider stream
  events can be consumed chunk by chunk instead of only after full-body parsing.
- Provider stream parsing now emits `ToolCallName` deltas alongside argument
  deltas, allowing streamed dynamic function calls to retain their tool names.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` uses streamed tool-call names when reconstructing
  provider tool calls, avoiding the previous shell fallback for argument-only
  streams.
- `yunxi-agent-protocol` now includes deep parity runtime event shapes for MCP
  session state, multi-agent state, context status, storage state, and file
  changes.
- `yunxi-agent-core`, `yunxi-agent-runtime`, and `yunxi-agent-cli` now carry
  context/storage state events through to protocol JSONL output.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` now owns a workspace MCP config loader and
  `McpSessionManager` with configured/initialized/failed/shutdown session
  state, stdio/http JSON-RPC request dispatch, tool/resource listing, resource
  read, and tool call boundaries.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` now injects enabled workspace MCP servers from
  `.yunxi/mcp.json`, `.yunxi/mcp-servers.json`, or `.mcp.json` into the dynamic
  provider tool registry and routes MCP calls through workspace session manager
  before falling back to injected runtime.
- `yunxi-agent-exec` now owns `ExecHandleRegistry` for long-running command
  status, cancellation request, output polling, and handle listing.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` now owns `EscalationResponse` and `EscalationOutcome`
  for approved/declined/not-available escalation results.
- `yunxi-agent-multi-agent` now owns child runtime request/result facade types
  without depending on the runtime crate, keeping the child execution boundary
  YunXi-owned and cycle-free.
- `yunxi-agent-context` now owns `ContextWindowPhase` and
  `PromptDebugSnapshot`, giving prompt/context debugging a structured state
  surface.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` now owns `RuntimeStateSnapshot` for session, parent,
  rollout, archive, and pin state reconstruction.
- Fixture tests cover incremental SSE decoding, MCP config dynamic tool
  injection, MCP config loading, and new protocol event round-trips.

Stage 4I first construction verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- --backend yunxi --jsonl "run stage 4i fixture"`:
  pass, including `storage_state` JSONL output
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; dependency keyword scan found no
  `codex`, `vendor`, or `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency in the default CLI tree
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only
- `cargo clean`: pass; removed 1.3GiB of build artifacts

## Stage 4I Second Construction Slice

Stage 4I continued with a second behavior-level parity construction slice. This
slice kept the build-first constraint: implementation was wired first, then the
full verification gate was run once.

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-tools` now carries structured `ToolRuntimeEvent` values on
  `ToolResponse`, allowing sandbox decisions, MCP session state, multi-agent
  state, and patch diagnostics to cross the tool/runtime boundary.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` maps tool runtime events into YunXi `AgentEvent`
  values, including MCP session JSONL events, multi-agent JSONL events,
  sandbox reasoning, and patch diagnostic warnings.
- `yunxi-agent-multi-agent` now owns a `ChildAgentRuntime` boundary,
  `FixtureChildAgentRuntime`, and `SpawnRun` command so child-agent execution
  has an autonomous YunXi-owned run-result path without depending on the
  runtime crate.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` exposes `spawn_run` as a model-visible multi-agent action
  and returns child run results plus multi-agent runtime events from the
  composite tool runtime.
- `yunxi-agent-patch` now rejects Codex-style `Add File` operations that would
  overwrite an existing target, rejects duplicate touched paths in a single
  patch, rejects move destinations that already exist, and reports non-UTF-8
  update targets with a dedicated diagnostic kind.
- New fixture tests cover child-agent spawn/run, runtime multi-agent event
  emission, multi-agent tool runtime events, and the new patch boundary
  diagnostics.

Stage 4I second construction verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass

  pass, including `storage_state` JSONL output
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; dependency keyword scan found no
  `codex`, `vendor`, or `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency in the default CLI tree
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only
- `cargo clean`: pass; removed 1.3GiB of build artifacts

## Stage 4J Planned Direction

The next stage is child runtime and end-to-end parity harness construction. Its
goal is to turn the Stage 4I `spawn_run` fixture boundary into a real
YunXi-owned child runtime turn, persist parent/child sessions in storage, merge
child lifecycle events into the parent JSONL stream, and establish the first
offline end-to-end parity harness for provider stream -> tool loop -> child
runtime -> storage -> JSONL.

The Stage 4J development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4j-child-runtime-e2e-parity-development-report.md`.

## Stage 4J Child Runtime And End-To-End Parity Harness Slice

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-runtime` now owns a real `YunXiChildAgentRuntime` adapter for
  `multi_agent spawn_run`, executes a child YunXi runtime turn, and writes the
  child session through YunXi-owned storage.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` assigns the parent session id at turn start and injects
  it into multi-agent requests so child sessions can persist `parent_id`
  metadata before the parent session is saved.
- `yunxi-agent-core` and `yunxi-agent-protocol` expose `ChildAgentEvent` /
  `child_agent` JSONL events carrying `agent_id`, `child_session_id`,
  `parent_session_id`, `status`, and `message`.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` `RuntimeStateSnapshot` and `storage_state` events now
  track child session ids and child session count.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` includes an offline Stage 4J fixture prompt that emits
  a parent `multi_agent spawn_run` tool call and then completes from the child
  tool result.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` has a depth guard for child runtime execution and
  returns structured child failure events instead of panicking or breaking the
  parent provider loop.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` maps child events to one-JSON-object-per-line JSONL output,
  and the CLI JSONL fixture verifies the emitted `child_agent` event shape.

Stage 4J construction verification passed on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- --backend yunxi --jsonl "run stage 4j child runtime fixture"`:
  pass, including parent `multi_agent`, scoped `child_agent`, and final
  `storage_state` JSONL events with `child_session_ids`
- JSONL parse check for the Stage 4J fixture: pass; 23 JSONL lines parsed and 8
  `child_agent` events observed
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; dependency keyword scan found no
  `codex`, `vendor`, or `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency in the default CLI tree
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only
- `cargo clean`: pass; removed 1.4GiB of build artifacts
- Local `.yunxi` smoke session artifacts from the Stage 4J fixture were removed

## Stage 4K Planned Direction

The next stage is DeepSeek live provider and real-world parity validation. Stage
4J proved the offline autonomous runtime chain; Stage 4K should connect that
chain to a real OpenAI-compatible provider using a DeepSeek API key stored
outside the repository at `<private-api-file>`.

The Stage 4K development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-10-yunxi-stage-4k-deepseek-live-provider-parity-development-report.md`.

Stage 4K focuses on:

- secret-safe DeepSeek smoke harness
- optional `YUNXI_PROVIDER_PROFILE=deepseek` compatibility profile
- provider error classification and redaction
- non-stream and stream DeepSeek live smoke matrix
- mapping live provider failures back to actionable parity buckets
- real model child provider path, while preserving deterministic fixture child
  provider tests
- async cancellation propagation across provider stream, tools, MCP calls, child
  runtime, and storage boundaries
- platform sandbox runner deepening, including Windows runner diagnostics and
  escalation-needed states
- long-lived MCP session reuse with shutdown, health check, timeout, and cancel
  hooks
- finer-grained child scoped stream events for child provider, tool, storage,
  cancellation, and finish states
- keeping the default YunXi CLI dependency tree free of `codex`, `vendor`, and
  `yunxi-agent-codex`

Live smoke must never print or persist API keys. All smoke artifacts, `.yunxi`
session output, and `target` build artifacts must be removed after verification.

## Stage 4K Construction Slice

Implemented in this construction slice before final verification:

- `yunxi-agent-provider` owns the `deepseek` provider profile, DeepSeek-compatible
  capability defaults, stream/non-stream switching through provider-neutral config,
  and redacted provider error classification.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` can run live-provider child agents through an inherited
  provider facade while preserving deterministic fixture child providers for
  offline tests.
- `yunxi-agent-core`, `yunxi-agent-runtime`, and `yunxi-agent-cli` now carry
  explicit cancellation events, provider error events, and child scoped stream
  events.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` exposes platform sandbox runner diagnostics for
  ready/denied/escalation-needed runner states.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` caches workspace MCP session managers for long-lived reuse
  and exposes sandbox runner/MCP lifecycle runtime events.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` exposes session health, cancel, shutdown, and shutdown-all
  lifecycle hooks.
- `scripts/provider/deepseek-live-smoke.ps1` provides the secret-safe DeepSeek
  live smoke harness.

Final unified verification was run on 2026-07-11:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- parity map`: pass
- Stage 4K offline JSONL fixtures: pass
  - child provider fixture: 30 JSONL lines, including `child_agent`,
    `child_scoped_stream`, and `storage_state`
  - cancellation fixture: 11 JSONL lines, including `cancelled`,
    `mcp_session`, `child_scoped_stream`, and `storage_state`
  - sandbox fixture: 17 JSONL lines, including sandbox runner output and tool
    completion
  - MCP reuse fixture: 28 JSONL lines, including repeated `mcp_session`
    lifecycle events
  - child scoped stream fixture: 45 JSONL lines, including granular
    `child_scoped_stream` events
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli` dependency scan: pass; no default
  `codex`, `vendor`, or `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency was found
- secret-pattern scan across `crates`, `docs`, and `scripts`: pass; no
  API-key-shaped secret, bearer token, or authorization bearer header pattern
  was found
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows LF/CRLF warnings only

DeepSeek live smoke was first attempted against
`<private-api-file>` without printing or persisting any key, but the
available key candidates were rejected by provider authentication. After the
user added a new key, live smoke was retried on 2026-07-11:

- `api.txt` contained six redacted key candidates; direct DeepSeek balance
  probes returned HTTP 200 for candidates 1 and 2 and HTTP 401 for candidates 3
  through 6.
- stream smoke with `deepseek-v4-flash`: pass, exit code 0, 39 JSONL lines,
  target response text observed, `secret_leak_detected=False`.
- non-stream smoke with `deepseek-v4-flash`: pass, exit code 0, 9 JSONL lines,
  target response text observed, `secret_leak_detected=False`.
- `scripts/provider/deepseek-live-smoke.ps1 -Model deepseek-v4-flash`: pass,
  exit code 0, 39 JSONL lines, `secret_leak_detected=False`.
- `scripts/provider/deepseek-live-smoke.ps1 -Model deepseek-v4-flash
  -NoStream`: pass, exit code 0, 9 JSONL lines,
  `secret_leak_detected=False`.

The Stage 4K owned runtime/provider/tool construction is verified offline, and
the DeepSeek live provider gate has now passed for both streaming and
non-streaming requests with the updated local credential file.

## Stage 4L Planned Direction

The next stage is Codex Agent deep parity closure. Stage 4K proved the
autonomous YunXi chain and the real DeepSeek live provider gate; Stage 4L should
move from runnable autonomy to deeper Codex CLI headless Agent behavior parity.

The Stage 4L development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-11-yunxi-stage-4l-codex-agent-deep-parity-closure-development-report.md`.

Stage 4L focuses on:

- thread/session/turn state machine deepening
- provider feature matrix and Responses-style item mapping
- unified exec and exec-server facade
- platform sandbox enforcement facade
- interactive approval and granular permission cache
- MCP auth, elicitation, approval template, capability negotiation, and tools
  cache
- skills/plugins runtime deepening and extension tool executor facade
- context manager, compact, prompt assets, and token budget semantics
- storage, rollout, thread-store, resume, fork, and truncation parity
- multi-agent v2 wait/message/follow-up/interrupt/list and sub-agent activity
  events
- protocol and JSONL full runtime event shape
- disabled-vendor parity harness plus DeepSeek live gate separation

Stage 4L must keep the build-first constraint: migrate and wire the full slice
first, avoid frequent mid-construction validation, then run the final unified
verification gate. Default YunXi CLI dependencies must remain free of
`codex-*`, `vendor/codex-rs`, and `yunxi-agent-codex`.

## Stage 4D History Restore And Compact Entry Slice

Implemented in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-storage` can reconstruct parent-linked session history from root
  to child through `SessionStore::history`.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` exposes `SessionHistory` and `HistoryItem` records for
  resume, history inspection, and future rollout reconstruction.
- `yunxi-agent-context` owns the first YunXi context-window budget model,
  approximate token counting, compact pressure status, and deterministic
  history compaction summary.
- `AgentConfig` carries optional context-window and auto-compact token limits.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` restores parent session history into provider messages
  before the current user prompt.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` compacts restored history into a system summary when the
  configured context budget is exceeded.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` exposes `sessions history <id>`.
- `yunxi-agent-cli sessions resume` now passes only the new user prompt and
  relies on runtime-owned history restore instead of embedding previous prompt
  text in the prompt string.

This slice is still a parity step, not the end state. It adds the autonomous
history restore and compact entry points required before migrating deeper Codex
context-manager behavior.

## Stage 4B Full Autonomy Slice

Implemented in this slice:

- The default workspace member set excludes `yunxi-agent-codex`.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` no longer depends on `yunxi-agent-codex`.
- `--backend codex` and `--live` report clear compatibility guidance in
  default builds.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` owns a shell command executor.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` can represent provider-requested tool calls.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` can execute provider-requested shell tools and feed
  results back into the provider loop.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` owns file-backed session records under
  `.yunxi/sessions`.

## Stage 4B Verification

Verified on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-core`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-provider`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-tools`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-storage`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-runtime`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- --cwd <temp> --backend yunxi --jsonl "explain this project"`:
  pass
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass; default tree contains no
  `yunxi-agent-codex`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or `codex-*` crates
- disabled-vendor verification: pass after temporarily renaming
  `vendor/codex-rs` to `vendor/codex-rs.disabled`
- `cargo check --manifest-path crates\yunxi-agent-codex\Cargo.toml`: pass
  without `codex-native`
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows line-ending warnings only

## Vendored Codex Source

Stage 3 imported the Codex Rust workspace source into `vendor/codex-rs` on
2026-07-10.

- Upstream commit at import time: `f1affbac5e5164b2bae825e9b39e9868bc4e0be2`
- Import style: mechanical full Rust workspace source snapshot
- Excluded during import: `target`, `.git`, `node_modules`
- Local patch record: `vendor/codex-rs/patches/README.md`

`yunxi-agent-codex` path dependencies now point at `vendor/codex-rs`, so the
native backend source is intended to be available from a fresh YunXi checkout
without manually creating `external/codex-rs`.

Stage 3 verification has now been run against the vendored source. The native
backend no longer depends on a developer-created `external/codex-rs` link for
Cargo path resolution.

## Local Codex Source Link

`external/codex-rs` may still exist in a developer workspace as a junction or
symlink to a local Codex CLI checkout. It is no longer the source of truth for
normal YunXi builds.

The `CodexSource` boundary verifies the checkout shape by checking for:

- `codex-rs/Cargo.toml`
- `codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs`
- `codex-rs/app-server-client/Cargo.toml`

The controller confirmed these three files exist in the real local checkout
used for this extraction, but that local path is intentionally not recorded
here.

## Stage 2 Live Backend

The Codex native backend has a source-level new-thread runner behind the
`codex-native` feature. Normal tests do not require live credentials.

Current live scope:

- text prompt
- new headless thread
- ephemeral run
- cwd/model/provider mapping
- approval and sandbox mapping
- in-process Codex app-server runtime
- JSONL event mapping into YunXi events

The in-process runtime is the upstream Codex Agent stack, so shell execution,
patches, AGENTS.md loading, MCP configuration, skills runtime, session storage,
and rollout behavior stay inside the embedded Codex runtime rather than being
reimplemented in YunXi core.

Still expanding:

- resume/history CLI flags
- full MCP fixture coverage
- skills fixture coverage
- Windows helper/arg0 packaging verification for patch and sandbox helpers
- owned extraction of selected upstream runner internals after the source-level
  bridge is stable

## Stage 2 Verification

Verified on 2026-07-09:

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-codex --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass
- gated live smoke without `YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`: pass and skipped
- dry-run CLI smoke: pass
- dry-run JSONL smoke: pass
- `git diff --check`: pass

Live credential smoke was not run; it remains gated by
`YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`.

## YunXi Agent v2.0.7 Interaction Focus Construction

Constructed and verified on 2026-07-21:

- Workspace and CLI product version promoted to `2.0.7` without changing
  persona-context or evaluation-harness schema versions.
- Added the YunXi-owned pure Rust `input_map` module with explicit
  `FocusTarget` and `TuiAction` semantics.
- Composer, History, Approval, and Details route Enter, Esc, Tab/BackTab,
  Ctrl+C, PgUp/PgDown, paste, and wheel actions without cross-view submission.
- Details now use a scrollable redacted main-content layer and restore the
  previous focus without changing Composer text/cursor, Approval selection, or
  transcript viewport state.
- Header/footer snapshots cover 80, 100, 120, and 200 columns; TUI tests pass
  130/130.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo check --workspace`, and
  `cargo test --workspace` pass.
- Release `yunxi.exe` and `yunxi-agent-cli.exe` both report `yunxi 2.0.7`;
  Companion Evaluation remains 31/31 with `golden_passed=true`.
- Real DeepSeek/Windows ConPTY v207 capture passes all eight scenarios; both
  v207 and historical v206 offline verifiers return `ok=true, scenarios=8`.
- Default runtime remains YunXi-owned and does not depend on `vendor/codex-rs`,
  `codex-*`, or `yunxi-agent-codex`.

## YunXi Agent v2.0.7-hotfix Focus Routing Remediation

Constructed as the v2.0.7 audit remediation candidate on 2026-07-21:

- Workspace and CLI product version are promoted to `2.0.7-hotfix`; persona
  context and Evaluation Harness schema versions remain independent.
- `input_map` classifies wheel input by `FocusTarget`: Composer/History scroll
  transcript rows, Approval is a no-op, and Details emits dedicated detail
  scroll actions.
- The terminal host shares one state handler for wheel, scrollbar click, drag,
  mouse-up, keys, and resize. Approval and Details cannot start or apply a
  `TranscriptScrollDrag`; Details wheel changes only `details_scroll`.
- Composer and History retain wheel, scrollbar, and PgUp/PgDown history
  navigation without mutating the grapheme-indexed Composer draft.
- TUI tests cover the four-focus action matrix, Approval viewport freeze,
  Details wheel/page scrolling and close restoration, and responsive footer
  behavior. Workspace/release/Evaluation gates pass; real hotfix ConPTY evidence
  covers Approval freeze and Details scroll/restore in 2/2 scenarios, while the
  historical v207/v206 verifiers remain 8/8 each.
- Default runtime remains YunXi-owned and does not depend on `vendor/codex-rs`,
  `codex-*`, or `yunxi-agent-codex`.

## YunXi Agent v1.8.3 Memory Merge Fidelity Construction

YunXi Agent v1.8.3 fixes the v1.8.2 memory merge fidelity gap where a later generic memory with the same `dedup_key` could overwrite a richer existing long-term memory.

Constructed in this slice:

- Added `yunxi-agent-persona::merge` as the canonical memory merge fidelity module.
- Added merge strategies for preserving existing rich content, promoting richer incoming content, combining non-conflicting details, and routing conflicts to confirmation.
- Reworked batch candidate dedup so provider-rich and rule-generic candidates in the same turn keep the richer content.
- Reworked storage `append_or_merge` to merge from existing + incoming records instead of using incoming as the unconditional base.
- Added language conflict family detection so Chinese/English preference conflicts do not overwrite active memory and can be routed to pending review.
- Added `merge_strategy` and `conflict_family` diagnostics to runtime/protocol events without exposing memory content in ordinary CLI/TUI notices.
- Updated runtime auto extraction so provider and rule candidates are deduplicated together.
- Updated version surfaces to `1.8.3`.

Unified verification passed on 2026-07-14 after construction completed.

Verified in this slice:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt --check`: pass
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-persona -p yunxi-agent-storage -p yunxi-agent-runtime -p yunxi-agent-cli -p yunxi-agent-tui`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests completed with zero failures
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass
- `target\release\yunxi.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.8.3`
- `target\release\yunxi-agent-cli.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.8.3`
- Isolated `YUNXI_HOME` black-box memory smoke: pass; rich existing content survived generic CLI follow-up, JSONL merge diagnostics did not leak memory content, pending records were listed but not recalled
- Owned-source secret scan excluding `vendor`, `extracted`, `target`, `.git`, and `.codegraph`: pass; only placeholders/fixtures matched
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only
- `codegraph sync .`: pass; 18 changed files synced
- `codegraph status .`: pass; index is up to date
- Install script and PATH smoke: pass; installed `yunxi` and `yunxi-agent-cli` report `1.8.3`
- `cargo clean`: pass; removed 13154 files and 3.4GiB

Known validation boundary:

- CLI offline rule extraction currently recognizes Chinese language preference rules but does not synthesize provider-level rich candidates or English language preference candidates from natural-language prompts. Rich incoming/provider-rich and language conflict write paths are covered by storage/runtime/protocol/TUI regression tests; black-box CLI validation covers the externally reachable merge follow-up, JSONL diagnostic, pending list, and recall filtering paths.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.5 Planned Direction

The next stage is the v1.7.5 CLI protocol and safety convergence slice. The
v1.7.4 CLI can run live provider, offline, JSON/JSONL, sessions, fixture tools,
multi-agent fixtures, and TUI, but the 2026-07-13 CLI audit found protocol and
surface issues that should be fixed before expanding more product features.

The v1.7.5 development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-13-yunxi-agent-v1-7-5-cli-protocol-safety-development-report.md`.

The planned implementation should:

- Make final assistant messages single-source in runtime/JSON/JSONL output.
- Emit generic `tool_completed` lifecycle events for completed MCP tool calls
  while preserving rich MCP response items.
- Avoid provider credential fallback warnings for explicitly selected dry-run
  or unavailable Codex compatibility backends.
- Reject conflicting `--json` and `--jsonl` output modes.
- Reject unsupported `--jsonl` on non-run subcommands instead of silently
  printing plain text.
- Make `sessions list --json` return lightweight summaries instead of full
  session records with embedded events.
- Clarify prompt/subcommand reserved-word behavior and provide an explicit run
  path or clear `--` guidance.
- Hide or explicitly reject the detached Codex backend placeholder in the
  default CLI surface.
- Keep sandbox output honest: the current sandbox is an advisory policy guard,
  not OS-level isolation.

The implementation stage should keep the project hard constraints: build the
whole slice first, avoid repeated mid-construction validation loops, then run
the unified verification gate and publish a new immutable `v1.7.5` tag only
after source implementation and verification complete. GitHub publishing must
continue through the REST API only, and old tags must not be deleted or moved.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.5 CLI Protocol Safety Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.5 turns the 2026-07-13 CLI audit findings into source-level
YunXi-owned behavior without reintroducing upstream Codex runtime dependencies.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.5`.
- Runtime provider response collection now detects when the provider stream has
  already emitted the complete assistant final message and avoids emitting a
  duplicate final `AgentEvent::Message`.
- CLI protocol mapping now emits generic `tool_completed` lifecycle events for
  completed MCP tool calls while preserving the richer `mcp_tool_call` item.
- Provider auto fallback warnings are limited to the real YunXi offline static
  runtime fallback and are no longer printed for explicit dry-run backend
  selection.
- `--json` and `--jsonl` are mutually exclusive.
- Unsupported `--jsonl` on metadata subcommands is rejected instead of silently
  printing plain text.
- `yunxi run [PROMPT]...` provides an explicit one-shot path for prompts that
  overlap with reserved subcommand names.
- The default CLI rejects the detached Codex compatibility backend before
  provider selection.
- `sessions list --json` now returns lightweight `SessionSummary` records
  instead of full event-bearing sessions.
- Sandbox attempt events now carry `os_isolation` and `enforcement` fields so
  consumers can see that the current layer is an advisory policy guard, not
  OS-level isolation.
- README, CLI/TUI current-version text, and CLI/JSONL tests were updated for
  the v1.7.5 behavior.

Unified verification is intentionally deferred until after the full construction
slice is complete, following the project hard constraint to avoid repeated
mid-construction validation loops.

Unified verification passed on 2026-07-13 after construction completed.

Verified in this slice:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures

- Stage 4M real parity fixture JSONL: pass; all started tool ids have matching
  `tool_completed`, including MCP ids `stage-4m-mcp-1` and
  `stage-4m-mcp-2`

  `enforcement=policy_guard`
- Dry-run backend smoke: pass; no provider auto fallback warning

## YunXi Agent v1.7.6 CLI/TUI Sandbox Hardening Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.6 addresses the 2026-07-13 CLI/TUI audit findings while
preserving the autonomous default runtime boundary and avoiding new upstream
Codex CLI runtime dependencies.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.6`.
- The default CLI hides the detached `codex` backend from the normal backend
  value list. `--live` now selects live provider mode instead of implying a
  Codex compatibility backend.
- CLI integration tests that exercise reserved prompt words and `run` prompts
  use explicit temporary `--cwd` paths to avoid leaving `.yunxi/` session
  output under crate source directories.
- The TUI banner, subheader, and footer render width-aware status strings so
  narrow terminals keep complete status tokens instead of dangling separators
  or half fields.
- TUI transcript wrapping is word-aware for ASCII text, keeps CJK/English mixed
  output together without injected spaces, and uses a quieter continuation
  gutter.
- The bottom pane uses a compact empty composer height and approval views show
  a command risk label derived from explicit metadata or command heuristics.
- Sandbox diagnostics now include `runner` and `unsupported_reason` fields in
  core events, protocol JSONL events, plain output, TUI debug details, and tool
  runtime events.
- The exec layer now routes process spawning through a first platform runner
  trait entrypoint while keeping current policy-only paths honest with
  `os_isolation=false` and `policy_guard` enforcement.

Unified verification passed on 2026-07-13 after source construction completed,
following the project hard constraint to avoid repeated mid-construction test
loops.

Verified in this slice:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-cli -p yunxi-agent-tui -p yunxi-agent-exec -p yunxi-agent-sandbox`:

- Install script and PATH smoke: pass; installed `yunxi` and
  `yunxi-agent-cli` report `1.7.6`

## YunXi Agent v1.7.7 Sandbox/TUI Hard Gate Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.7 closes the v1.7.6 hard-gate findings without adding new
product modules or reintroducing upstream Codex CLI runtime dependencies.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.7`.
- Sandbox diagnostics now include a stable machine-readable
  `enforcement_level` in core events, protocol JSONL events, tool runtime
  events, plain CLI output, and TUI debug details.
- Sandbox backend labels distinguish `policy_only`, `process_lifecycle`,
  `os_restricted`, and `policy_bypass`. The default Windows path reports
  `process_lifecycle` with `os_isolation=false`; unverified Landlock paths
  remain `policy_only`; `danger-full-access` reports `policy_bypass`.
- The exec crate includes platform runner boundary modules documenting that
  Windows restricted-token filesystem isolation and Linux Landlock isolation
  are not enabled in this build.
- Sandbox acceptance coverage now exercises read-only write escalation,
  workspace-write absolute path escape, workspace-write symlink escape,
  disabled-network escalation, policy-bypass execution, and honest
  non-OS-isolated diagnostics.
- TUI approval layout uses a shared bounded layout calculation for both
  `desired_height_for_width(width)` and render output. Long cwd, reason, and
  command text is pre-wrapped with row caps so Approve, Decline, and
  `Tab changes selection` remain visible on 58-column terminals.
- TUI header/subheader priority now keeps provider, mode, and truncated model
  visible on medium-width terminals before spending space on cwd.
- CLI metadata help marks `--jsonl` as agent-execution only, while metadata
  subcommands continue to reject it and direct users to `--json`.

Unified verification passed on 2026-07-13 after source construction completed,
in line with the project constraint to avoid repeated mid-construction test
loops.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.2 TUI Scroll And Streaming Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.2 deepens the v1.7.1 TUI host without changing the autonomous
runtime/provider/tool/storage boundary. The default CLI remains independent
from upstream Codex runtime source dependencies.

Implemented on 2026-07-12:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.2`.
- `yunxi-agent-tui` now has a transcript viewport state that supports mouse
  wheel scrolling, PageUp/PageDown/Home/End navigation, follow-tail behavior,
  and a `new output below` status when model/tool output arrives while the user
  is reading history.
- The TUI host enables mouse capture, drains navigation events during active
  streaming turns, handles resize redraws, and throttles non-critical redraws
  through a frame scheduler.
- Transcript rendering now shows a scroll window selected by the viewport,
  a scrollbar, line range/title status, and a footer that reflects tail/history
  state while keeping composer, approval, and user-input panes fixed.
- Markdown streaming has an explicit stable/live controller for newline-gated
  commit behavior and future table holdback work.
- CLI renderer plumbing adds `tick()` and `flush()` hooks. Plain, one-shot,
  JSON, JSONL, and sessions paths keep their existing behavior.
- `.gitignore` now excludes local `.yunxi/` session runtime output.

Release publication is handled through GitHub REST API only. The release must
create a new annotated tag `v1.7.2` and leave all prior version tags intact.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.3 TUI Event Filtering Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.3 turns the v1.7.2 scrollable TUI transcript from a raw event
log into a user-facing conversation and tool timeline.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.3`.
- `yunxi-agent-tui` now owns an event filter that classifies runtime events
  into user-visible transcript items, debug-only details, tool timeline
  updates, warnings, and errors.
- Raw `CommandUpdated` stdout, provider bookkeeping, context status, storage
  state, and successful advisory sandbox attempts are hidden from the normal
  transcript.
- Tool, shell, approval, escalation, and MCP lifecycle events are merged into
  compact timeline cells with approval/running/completed/failure steps.
- Long skill/tool outputs, protocol JSON, and tool arguments are redacted,
  summarized, and stored in a TUI debug/detail buffer instead of being rendered
  directly in the main transcript.
- TUI users can enable raw debug event summaries with `/debug events on`, hide
  them with `/debug events off`, and inspect the latest or selected redacted
  detail with `/details [id]`.
- Plain, JSON, JSONL, and one-shot output paths remain outside the TUI filter.

Verification for this slice passed on 2026-07-13 after the unified verification
gate completed:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures

  `arguments_json`, full skill documents, and context token status while
  preserving tool timeline steps
- DeepSeek streaming, non-streaming, and interactive live smokes: pass with
  `secret_leak_detected=False`
- Default CLI dependency scan: pass; no `codex`, `vendor`, or
  `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency appeared in the default CLI tree
- Owned-source secret scan: pass after excluding `vendor`, `extracted`,
  `target`, `.git`, and `.codegraph`

- `codegraph sync "D:\YunXi Agent"` and `codegraph status "D:\YunXi Agent"`:
  pass; index is up to date
- Install script and PATH smoke: pass; installed `yunxi` reports `1.7.3`

## YunXi Agent v1.5 Honesty Streaming Safety Construction

YunXi Agent v1.5 promotes the project from "usable terminal agent with some
fixture-heavy parity scaffolding" toward a more honest autonomous CLI runtime.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.5.0`.
- `yunxi` and `yunxi-agent-cli` report `yunxi 1.5.0`.
- Interactive banner reports `YunXi Agent v1.5.0 interactive CLI`.
- Offline plain-text assistant output is marked with `[offline]`.
- Auto provider fallback prints an explicit warning when no live credentials are
  configured.
- Offline runtime banner now says the default static provider has stage
  fixtures disabled by default.
- `/cost` reports `n/a - offline, no model call` in offline mode.
- Sandbox/runner display text now uses policy guard/advisory wording and says
  there is no OS isolation in the current v1.5 implementation.
- `StaticProvider` stage fixture branches are disabled by default.
- Runtime `stage 4k/4l/4m` fixture branches are disabled by default.
- Explicit fixture mode is available through `YUNXI_RUNTIME_FIXTURES=1` and
  runtime test builders; fixture metadata includes `fixture_mode=true`.
- Provider transport responses now retain response headers for retry decisions.
- Provider retry uses bounded exponential backoff, honors `Retry-After`, and
  retries timeout/network transport failures within the retry budget.
- Live OpenAI-compatible streaming can consume `reqwest::Response::bytes_stream`
  chunks and push parsed SSE events into the runtime event sink as chunks
  arrive.
- Default CLI dependency boundaries remain YunXi-owned and do not require
  `vendor/codex-rs`, `codex-*`, or `yunxi-agent-codex`.

Verification for v1.5 is intentionally deferred until the full construction
slice is complete, following the project hard constraint to avoid repeated
single-point testing during the build phase.

## YunXi Agent v1.3 Terminal Streaming Approval Cancellation

YunXi Agent v1.3 upgrades the interactive terminal host from batch replay to a
streaming control boundary while preserving the existing one-shot, JSON, JSONL,
storage, and offline fixture paths.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.3.0`.
- `yunxi-agent-core` owns `AgentRunControl`,
  `AgentRunStreamReceiver`, interactive approval request/decision types, and
  interactive user-input request/response types.
- `AgentBackend::run_stream` and `Agent::run_with_backend_stream` expose a
  YunXi-owned streaming run boundary while preserving the old batch `run`
  surface.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` writes every emitted event to both the returned
  `AgentRunResult` event list and the live event channel.
- Interactive approval and escalation decisions now flow from runtime to the
  CLI and back into the current tool request before execution.
- Interactive `request_user_input` now returns CLI input to the provider tool
  result channel instead of always declining.
- Ctrl+C sets the shared cancellation token; runtime checks it at provider/tool
  loop boundaries, and `yunxi-agent-exec` can kill a running shell child through
  `run_with_cancellation`.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` keeps the old `execute` API and adds
  `execute_with_control` for cancellation-aware tool execution.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` interactive mode renders events live, prompts for approval
  and user input, keeps the REPL alive across failed turns, and reports
  `YunXi Agent v1.3.0 interactive CLI`.
- Terminal rendering now includes file changes, patch status, todo updates,
  completion usage, and a real `/clear`.
- Runtime and exec tests cover streaming-before-completion, approval approve
  and deny, request_user_input, and cancellation propagation to shell exec.

Verified on 2026-07-12:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures.
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass without warnings.

  detected secret leak.
- PATH installed `yunxi 1.3.0`: pass; installed binary SHA-256 matched the
  release build.
- PATH installed DeepSeek live JSONL smoke: pass with no detected secret leak.
- default CLI dependency scan: pass; no `codex-*`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or
  `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency appeared in the default CLI tree.
- owned-source secret scan excluding generated and reference trees: pass.
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only.
- `codegraph sync "D:\YunXi Agent"`: pass; 14 changed files synced.

The v1.3 default CLI remains independent from upstream Codex runtime
dependencies. This release does not add TUI, desktop app, cloud tasks, update,
doctor, completion, marketplace, or SDK packaging surfaces.

## YunXi Agent v1.4 Terminal Command Surface Construction

YunXi Agent v1.4 extends the v1.3 interactive terminal runtime with Codex-like
REPL inspection commands. This slice keeps the default CLI independent from
upstream Codex runtime dependencies and focuses on user-visible operational
state inside an active terminal session.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.4.0`.
- `yunxi` and `yunxi-agent-cli` report `yunxi 1.4.0`.
- Interactive banner reports `YunXi Agent v1.4.0 interactive CLI`.
- `/tools` lists YunXi fixed tools and workspace dynamic tools.
- `/mcp` lists workspace MCP configuration and fixture seed presence without
  starting MCP servers.
- `/cost` reports last-turn and session token usage.
- `/status` reports provider/session status, observed runtime events, last-turn
  event summary, tool counts, MCP server count, and usage.
- Interactive turns now keep a compact in-memory summary of event counts,
  usage, final response presence, warnings, errors, approvals, escalations,
  child streams, file changes, tools, commands, and MCP activity.

Verified on 2026-07-12:

- `cargo fmt`: pass.
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass.
- `cargo test`: pass after fixing one compile-time event-summary exhaustiveness
  gap for `CommandUpdated`; workspace tests and doc tests completed with zero

  and Stage 4M real parity JSONL smoke: pass.
- DeepSeek streaming, non-streaming, and interactive live smoke: pass with no
  detected secret leak.
- default CLI dependency scan: pass; no `codex-*`, `vendor/codex-rs`, or
  `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency appeared in the default CLI tree.
- owned-source secret scan excluding generated and reference trees: pass.
- `git diff --check`: pass with Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings only.
- release install and PATH `yunxi --version`: pass; installed binary reports
  `yunxi 1.4.0` and SHA-256 matches the release binary.
- `codegraph sync "D:\YunXi Agent"`: pass; 5 changed files synced.
- Stage 4M temporary `.yunxi/` and `stage4m-runtime.txt` artifacts were removed
  after path-boundary checks.

## YunXi Agent v1.2 DeepSeek Default Provider Construction

YunXi Agent v1.2 connects the existing YunXi-owned DeepSeek transport to the
normal one-shot, interactive, and session-resume CLI paths. Provider selection
is now designed as an explicit auto/live/offline decision rather than the v1.1
`provider_live` boolean being interpreted independently by each CLI surface.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace-owned crate versions are promoted to `1.2.0`.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` supports deterministic environment lookup injection,
  automatic DeepSeek profile inference from `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, credential
  source precedence, and non-secret credential availability probing.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` owns `provider_mode.rs` and shares one provider decision
  across one-shot, interactive, and `sessions resume` execution.
- Default `auto` mode selects a live provider when credentials are configured
  and otherwise selects the labelled offline provider.
- `--provider-live` forces live mode and fails before HTTP execution when the
  selected provider has no credentials.
- `--offline` forces deterministic offline execution and conflicts with
  `--provider-live`.
- Interactive banner and `/session` output show provider mode, resolution
  source, provider name, and model without showing authentication values.
- Live selections materialize the resolved provider and model into each turn's
  `AgentConfig`, so turn metadata, session storage, and resume preserve the
  actual DeepSeek configuration; offline selections leave config unchanged.
- Existing deterministic CLI and JSONL tests explicitly select `--offline`, so
  a developer's user-level API credentials cannot make the suite contact a
  real model endpoint.
- `scripts/provider/import-deepseek-credential.ps1` imports one local
  credential candidate into user environment variables without printing it;
  multi-candidate files require an explicit one-based candidate index.
- `scripts/provider/deepseek-live-smoke.ps1` requires an explicit `-ApiFile`;
  the repository no longer contains a personal credential-file path.
- README documents automatic DeepSeek selection, explicit overrides, secure
  import, immutable version tags, and GitHub API-only publication.

Construction followed the project hard constraint: no tests, checks, builds,
formatters, or live requests were run while the slice was being wired. The
single unified v1.2 verification gate then completed on 2026-07-11.

Verified on 2026-07-11:

- `cargo fmt` and `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass.
- `cargo test`: pass; 190 workspace tests completed with zero failures.
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass without warnings after removing one stale
  CLI import found by the first unified run.
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass.
- Both release binaries report `yunxi 1.2.0`.
- Offline one-shot, piped interactive, argument-conflict, missing-prompt JSONL,
  parity map, and `git diff --check` gates: pass.
- Default CLI dependency scan: pass; no `vendor/codex-rs`, `codex-*`, or
  `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency is present.
- Owned-source scan: 108 release-scope files, zero secret-pattern matches, and zero personal
  API-file-path matches. Reference-only `vendor` and `extracted` trees were
  excluded by normalized path segment rather than slash-sensitive regex.
- DeepSeek stream smoke: pass; 48 JSONL events and no detected secret leak.
- DeepSeek non-stream smoke: pass; 19 JSONL events and no detected secret leak.
- Default auto one-shot: pass; returned real DeepSeek assistant content and did
  not return the offline fixture response.
- Auto JSONL metadata: pass; 48 valid JSONL events included two turn metadata
  events with provider `deepseek` and model `deepseek-v4-flash`.
- Default auto interactive startup: pass; reported `live`, `auto_live`, and
  `deepseek` without exposing credentials.
- Multi-candidate credential import: pass; missing explicit index was rejected,
  index 1 imported successfully, and output leak detection was false.
- Installed PATH binary verification: pass; its SHA-256 matched the final release
  build and installed v1.2 used the user-level DeepSeek environment for both
  interactive startup and a real one-shot turn.

Release closure:

- `v1.2.0` was created from the final release commit only after the unified
  gate passed; `v1.0.0` and `v1.1.0` remain unchanged.
- The default CLI remains independent from `vendor/codex-rs`, `codex-*`, and
  `yunxi-agent-codex`.
- GitHub master/tree/commit/tag state was published and verified only through
  the GitHub REST API; Git transport push/fetch commands were not used.
- The final source index and desktop development log were synchronized, then
  generated `target`, root `.yunxi`, and temporary smoke artifacts were
  cleaned.

## YunXi Agent v1.2.1 Interactive Provider Recovery Construction

YunXi Agent v1.2.1 corrects the interactive turn lifecycle exposed by a
DeepSeek HTTP 400 response. A failed provider, tool, or network turn is now
contained at the REPL boundary: the error is rendered safely, the last
successful session state is preserved, and the next user input can run without
restarting YunXi.

DeepSeek 400/422 responses receive one compatibility fallback that removes only
the optional top-level request `metadata`. Tools, messages, model selection,
and all other provider behavior remain intact. If the fallback also fails,
YunXi extracts only structured error message/type/code fields, redacts
token-like content, and bounds the displayed detail to 240 characters.

Tool-loop history now preserves the assistant `tool_calls` message and sends
each `role=tool` result with its matching `tool_call_id`. This closes the
protocol defect identified by DeepSeek's structured error detail after the
initial interactive recovery patch was installed.

The live smoke helper now has a genuine interactive mode that sends an actual
prompt and requires the expected assistant marker plus explicit `/exit`
completion. Provider tests cover the fallback and safe diagnostics; a CLI
integration test covers first-turn 400/400 failure followed by a successful
second prompt without process termination.

This patch is prepared for immutable tag `v1.2.1`; release must preserve
`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, and `v1.2.0` unchanged. The default CLI remains
independent of upstream Codex runtime dependencies.

Verified on 2026-07-12:

- `cargo test`: pass; 196 workspace tests, zero failures.
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass without warnings.
- release dual binaries: pass; both report `yunxi 1.2.1`.
- local sequential HTTP REPL recovery: pass.
- DeepSeek stream/non-stream/interactive prompt: pass with no detected secret
  leak.
- installed PATH binary from `C:\Users\admin`: “你好” produced a completed
  assistant turn and exited only after `/exit`, with no provider HTTP 400.
- default CLI dependency tree and owned-source privacy scans: pass.

## Stage 4L Deep Parity Closure Construction

Stage 4L construction has added YunXi-owned facade and runtime fixture coverage
for the 12 deep Codex CLI headless Agent parity surfaces described in
`docs/reports/2026-07-11-yunxi-stage-4l-codex-agent-deep-parity-closure-development-report.md`.

Constructed in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-core` now owns thread state, turn metadata, turn state, and
  deep parity state event carriers.
- `yunxi-agent-protocol` now exposes `thread_state`, `turn_state`, and
  `deep_parity_state` JSONL runtime events alongside the existing stable
  runtime envelope.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` maps the new core events into protocol JSONL without
  changing older event shapes.
- `yunxi-agent-runtime` now has an offline
  `stage 4l deep parity fixture` path that emits all 12 closure layers, plus
  exec, approval, sandbox escalation, MCP lifecycle, skills, context,
  storage, multi-agent, and child scoped stream events.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` owns a `ProviderFeatureMatrix` facade for
  provider-neutral item mapping, capabilities, schema strictness, and retry
  buckets.
- `yunxi-agent-exec` owns `UnifiedExecRequest`, `UnifiedExecAttempt`,
  `ExecServerSession`, and shell snapshot facade types.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` owns sandbox attempt and session approval cache facade
  types.
- `yunxi-agent-mcp` owns capability negotiation and long-lived session facade
  types for auth, elicitation, tools/resources cache, and session reuse.
- `yunxi-agent-skills` owns runtime catalog and extension tool executor facade
  types.
- `yunxi-agent-context` owns `ContextManagerState` for prompt assets, compact
  state, token budget, and prompt debug snapshots.
- `yunxi-agent-storage` owns thread-store and rollout parity snapshot facade
  types.
- `yunxi-agent-multi-agent` owns mailbox, communication kind, activity, and
  budget sharing facade types.
- Runtime, CLI JSONL, and protocol round-trip tests were added for the Stage 4L
  fixture and new event shapes.

Stage 4L verification was run after construction completed, following the
project hard constraint to avoid mid-construction test runs.

  `child_scoped_stream:3`, `tool_started:3`, `tool_completed:2`, plus
  thread, turn, metadata, approval, escalation, context, storage, multi-agent,
  child-agent, item, item-delta, and completion events.
- `cargo tree -p yunxi-agent-cli`: pass

- A broader reference-inclusive scan still reports four pre-existing
  `extracted/codex-core-agent-sources` files containing bearer-header code
  literals from upstream reference source. No secret value was printed and no
  Stage 4L owned source file matched.

- `cargo clean`: pass; removed 7429 files and 1.6GiB.
- Root `.yunxi` cleanup: pass.

## Stage 4M Planned Direction

The next stage is real runtime parity deepening. Stage 4L proved the deep
parity facade, JSONL shape, and synthetic mega fixture. Stage 4M should connect
those facade surfaces to real YunXi runtime behavior: runtime drivers,
provider feature matrix request shaping, unified exec handles, sandbox attempt
records, approval cache, MCP long-lived sessions, skills/plugins runtime
catalog, context auto-compact, rollout-backed resume, multi-agent v2 routing,
and a real parity mega fixture.

The Stage 4M development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-11-yunxi-stage-4m-real-runtime-parity-deepening-development-report.md`.

Stage 4M execution should keep the existing hard constraint: build and wire the
whole slice first, avoid mid-construction verification, then run the final
verification gate once construction is complete.

## Stage 4M Real Runtime Parity Construction

Stage 4M construction is being implemented against
`docs/reports/2026-07-11-yunxi-stage-4m-real-runtime-parity-deepening-development-report.md`.

Constructed in this slice:

- `yunxi-agent-runtime` now has small YunXi-owned runtime driver modules for
  thread state, turn metadata, turn phase state, and session approval-cache
  probing.
- Normal YunXi runtime turns now emit `thread_state`, `turn_metadata`, and
  `turn_state` events from the main path instead of reserving those events for
  the Stage 4L synthetic fixture.
- Provider calls now publish feature-matrix driven turn-state data, and
  `yunxi-agent-provider` uses `ProviderFeatureMatrix` while shaping
  OpenAI-compatible request JSON.
- Tool execution now maps sandbox runner diagnostics into a structured
  `sandbox_attempt` runtime event and maps approval cache decisions into
  `approval_cache_state`.
- Context assembly now records a `ContextManagerState` projection for AGENTS.md
  fragments, file mentions, restored history, token estimates, and compact
  summary metadata.
- A new `stage 4m real parity fixture` follows the real runtime chain:
  provider -> context -> approval cache -> sandbox decision -> shell exec ->
  patch -> MCP -> skill -> tool search -> multi-agent child -> storage ->
  JSONL.
- The Stage 4L synthetic fixture remains available as the protocol-shape
  fallback, while Stage 4M adds 12 `deep_parity_state` summary layers derived
  from events observed on the real runtime path.

Stage 4M final unified verification passed on 2026-07-11 after construction
completed, following the project hard constraint to avoid mid-construction
test loops.

- Default CLI dependency keyword scan: pass; no `vendor/codex-rs`,
  `codex-*`, or `yunxi-agent-codex` dependency appeared in the default CLI
  tree
- Owned-source secret scan excluding `vendor`, `extracted`, `target`, `.git`,

  pass; exit code 0, 19 JSONL lines, `secret_leak_detected=False`

Stage 4M therefore moves the Stage 4L synthetic deep-parity facade into a
real YunXi runtime parity chain for provider, context, approval cache,
sandbox attempt records, tools, MCP reuse, skills, child scoped streams,
storage, protocol JSONL, and 12-layer deep parity summaries while keeping the
default CLI independent from upstream Codex runtime dependencies.

## YunXi Agent v1.6 Policy Guard Hardening Construction

YunXi Agent v1.6 promotes the v1.5 policy-guard honesty work into stronger
process-internal enforcement. The release still does not claim OS-level sandbox
isolation, but the default shell tool path no longer bypasses the configured
`ToolPolicy` with trusted `DangerFullAccess`.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.6.0`.
- One-shot, JSON, JSONL, and `sessions resume` paths now surface the same auto
  provider fallback warning as interactive mode when no live credentials are
  configured.
- `yunxi-agent-tools` passes the request `ToolPolicy.execution_policy` into
  `ExecCommand::shell` for default shell execution.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` adds shell-ish tokenization, token-aware command risk
  classification, command target extraction, and workspace-write target escape
  blocking for common redirection/copy/move/delete/write forms.
- `yunxi-agent-provider` prevents streaming retry and DeepSeek schema fallback
  after body bytes have reached the stream parser, avoiding duplicated stream
  events after partial output.
- The unused non-Windows `platform_shell` helper in `yunxi-agent-tools` was
  removed so cross-target compilation no longer depends on a dead missing
  import.

Verification for this slice is recorded in the v1.6 development report after
the unified verification gate completes.

## YunXi Agent v1.7 Terminal TUI Foundation Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7 promotes the terminal host from a plain `read_line` REPL into
a TUI-capable interactive shell while preserving script-oriented output. This
release also adds symlink escape regression coverage for the v1.6
process-internal workspace-write guard.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.0`.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` gains terminal dependencies for `ratatui`, `crossterm`, and
  `reedline`.
- Interactive startup resolves a terminal mode: real terminal stdin/stdout use
  the TUI-capable host by default, while pipes, JSON, JSONL, and `--no-tui`
  remain on the stable plain path.
- CLI input is split behind an `InteractiveInput` abstraction with a plain
  line reader and a Reedline-backed terminal reader.
- Interactive rendering is split behind an `InteractiveRenderer` abstraction
  with the existing plain renderer and a basic TUI renderer.
- The TUI app state renders a compact header, event log, and input area and is
  covered by `ratatui::backend::TestBackend` tests.
- `yunxi-agent-sandbox` now resolves the nearest existing path prefix before
  falling back to component normalization, allowing symlink parent directories
  to be detected even when the final target file does not exist yet.
- Sandbox and tools tests include symlink escape regressions where the platform
  allows symlink creation.

Verification for this slice is recorded in the v1.7 development report. The
2026-07-12 gate passed `cargo fmt`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo test`,
`cargo check --workspace`, release build, version checks, plain interactive
smoke, auto fallback smoke, DeepSeek live JSON/JSONL smoke, dependency scan,
secret scan, `git diff --check`, CodeGraph sync, release install, and PATH
smoke. Linux cross-target check is recorded as environment-blocked because the
configured rustup mirror returned 404 for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` std.

## YunXi Agent v1.0 CLI Packaging

YunXi Agent v1.0 packages the current verified autonomous runtime as a
terminal-first CLI product.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.0.0`.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` now builds the primary `yunxi` binary and keeps
  `yunxi-agent-cli` as a compatibility binary.
- CLI metadata now presents the command as `YunXi Agent v1.0 terminal CLI`.
- `scripts/install/install-yunxi.ps1` installs release binaries into a
  user-local bin directory and can optionally add that directory to the user
  PATH.
- README now documents v1.0 install, source run, installed run, and
  environment-based live provider usage.

The v1.0 CLI package is still intentionally headless. It does not add TUI,
desktop, cloud task, updater, doctor, completion, marketplace, or installer
surfaces beyond the local PowerShell install helper.

## YunXi Agent v1.1 Planned Direction

The next product stage is YunXi Agent v1.1 interactive CLI. The v1.0 package is
installable and callable from PowerShell, but its default command surface is
still a headless one-shot runner: `yunxi "prompt"` runs one turn, while `yunxi`
without a prompt reports `a prompt is required`.

YunXi Agent v1.1 should make `yunxi` without a prompt enter an interactive
terminal session while preserving one-shot script compatibility. The v1.1
development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-11-yunxi-agent-v1-1-interactive-cli-development-report.md`.

The v1.1 implementation should connect the already autonomous runtime/provider
chain to a terminal host with:

- REPL input loop and slash commands.
- Stable one-shot, JSON, and JSONL compatibility.
- Session id reuse, history restore, and `/resume`.
- Live provider configuration through replaceable provider interfaces.
- Streaming terminal renderer for assistant deltas and tool lifecycle events.
- Ctrl+C cancellation for the active turn without losing the whole REPL.
- Interactive approval and escalation prompts.
- MCP, skills, and child scoped stream visibility in terminal output.
- Version/documentation/install updates for `1.1.0`.

The same project constraints continue to apply: default `yunxi` must not depend
on `vendor/codex-rs`, `codex-*`, or `yunxi-agent-codex`; API keys must never be
printed or committed; construction should be done as one build slice and the
full verification gate should run only after the slice is wired.

## Version Tagging Policy

Starting with the v1.1 work, every version change must create a new Git tag and
must keep all previous version tags. Tags are rollback anchors and must not be
deleted during normal development or release cleanup.

## YunXi Agent v1.1 Interactive CLI Construction

YunXi Agent v1.1 upgrades the v1.0 headless one-shot CLI into an interactive
terminal CLI while preserving script-oriented one-shot, JSON, and JSONL
compatibility.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.1.0`.
- `yunxi` and `yunxi-agent-cli` now report `yunxi 1.1.0`.
- `yunxi` without a prompt enters an interactive REPL instead of returning
  `a prompt is required`.
- One-shot mode remains available through `yunxi "prompt"`.
- `--json` and `--jsonl` without a prompt continue to return structured
  invalid-input errors instead of entering the REPL.
- `yunxi-agent-cli` owns small CLI-side modules for interactive command parsing,
  terminal rendering, and REPL/session orchestration.
- Interactive mode supports `/help`, `/session`, `/resume <session_id>`,
  `/model`, `/provider`, `/cwd`, `/clear`, `/exit`, and `/quit`.
- Interactive turns reuse the existing YunXi-owned runtime and session storage
  path, carrying the active session id forward through parent-linked history.
- Terminal rendering now shows assistant messages, reasoning, shell/tool/MCP
  lifecycle events, approval/escalation events, child scoped stream events,
  context status, storage state, warnings, provider errors, and cancellation
  status in a readable non-JSON form.
- Ctrl+C is wired at the CLI host boundary to cancel the active turn future and
  return control to the REPL.
- Live provider interactive startup checks that a provider key source exists
  before entering the REPL, without printing key values.
- README documents v1.1 interactive usage and the version tag policy.
- The user-local PATH install was refreshed with the v1.1 release binaries.

The v1.1 default CLI dependency graph remains independent from upstream Codex
runtime dependencies. This release adds the interactive terminal host layer on
top of the already autonomous YunXi runtime; it does not introduce TUI,
desktop app, cloud tasks, update, doctor, completion, marketplace, or new
installer surfaces beyond the existing local PowerShell install helper.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.4 Planned Direction

The next TUI stage is the v1.7.4 scrollbar and viewport correction slice. The
v1.7.3 TUI now filters protocol noise and shows a cleaner transcript, but user
testing shows that the transcript scrollbar can appear stuck around the middle
and cannot be dragged with the mouse.

The v1.7.4 development report is recorded in
`docs/reports/2026-07-13-yunxi-agent-v1-7-4-tui-scrollbar-viewport-development-report.md`.

The planned implementation should:

- Replace transcript logical-line scrolling with wrapped-screen-row scrolling.
- Share one TUI layout geometry between rendering and mouse hit-testing.
- Add transcript scrollbar geometry and mouse drag state.
- Keep wheel, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End, and tail-follow behavior working.
- Keep v1.7.3 event filtering, tool timeline, and debug/details behavior intact.
- Continue avoiding default runtime dependencies on `vendor/codex-rs`,
  `codex-*`, or `yunxi-agent-codex`.

The implementation stage should keep the project hard constraint: build the
whole slice first, avoid repeated mid-construction validation loops, then run
the unified verification gate and publish a new immutable `v1.7.4` tag only
after source implementation and verification complete.

## YunXi Agent v1.7.4 TUI Scrollbar Viewport Construction

YunXi Agent v1.7.4 promotes the TUI transcript scroll model from logical lines
to wrapped screen rows and adds mouse-drag scrollbar control.

Constructed in this slice:

- Workspace package version is promoted to `1.7.4`.
- `yunxi-agent-tui` now owns a shared `layout` module so rendering and mouse
  hit-testing use the same header, transcript, transcript-inner, scrollbar, and
  bottom-pane rectangles.
- `yunxi-agent-tui` now owns a `transcript_layout` module that converts
  filtered transcript cells into styled, pre-wrapped screen rows before
  viewport slicing.
- TUI transcript rendering no longer relies on `Paragraph.wrap` for the main
  transcript content; title ranges and scrollbar state now use wrapped row
  counts.
- `TranscriptViewport` keeps tail-follow bottom-offset behavior while adding
  explicit start-row and scroll-fraction setters for precise scrollbar drag.
- `yunxi-agent-tui` now owns a `scrollbar` geometry module for thumb sizing,
  hit-testing, and drag-y to start-row mapping.
- The TUI host handles left-button scrollbar down/drag/up, track page clicks,
  and transcript-scoped mouse wheel events without changing composer and
  approval overlay input behavior.
- README and the v1.7.4 development report document the wrapped-row scrollbar
  correction.

Unified verification passed on 2026-07-13 after construction completed,
following the project hard constraint to avoid mid-construction test loops.

Verified in this slice:

- `cargo fmt`: pass
- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass; workspace unit tests, integration tests, and doc tests
  completed with zero failures
- `cargo check --workspace`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --release --bins`: pass
- `target\release\yunxi.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.7.4`
- `target\release\yunxi-agent-cli.exe --version`: pass; `yunxi 1.7.4`
- `target\release\yunxi.exe --offline "v1.7.4 offline smoke"`: pass
- Plain `--no-tui` interactive smoke: pass
- JSON and JSONL offline smoke: pass
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-tui`: pass; 31 TUI tests covered wrapped rows,
  scrollbar geometry, viewport start/fraction mapping, shared layout metrics,
  and transcript rendering
- DeepSeek live stream smoke with `deepseek-chat`: pass; 28 JSONL lines,
  `secret_leak_detected=False`

## Stage 3 Verification

Verified on 2026-07-10:

- `cargo fmt -- --check`: pass
- `cargo test`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-codex --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo check -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo build -p yunxi-agent-cli --features codex-native`: pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- --backend dry-run "explain this project"`:
  pass
- `cargo run -p yunxi-agent-cli -- --backend dry-run --jsonl "explain this project"`:
  pass
- `cargo test -p yunxi-agent-codex --features codex-native live_codex_backend_can_complete_simple_prompt_when_enabled -- --nocapture`:
  pass and skipped without `YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`
- `git diff --check`: pass

During the first native check, the `v8` crate failed while decompressing the
downloaded `rusty_v8` prebuilt library. The failed build-script output and
temporary `rusty_v8` target files were removed, and the same native check passed
on the next run. No source change was needed for that transient artifact issue.

Live credential smoke was not run; it remains gated by
`YUNXI_RUN_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1`.
